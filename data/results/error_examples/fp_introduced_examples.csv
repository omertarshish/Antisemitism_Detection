Here's a breakdown of why this conclusion was reached:

1. **Lack of Context**: Without additional information, it's unclear what the tweet is referring to or expressing. It could be part of a conversation about Israel as a country, potentially relating to topics like sports, immigration, or relocation.

2. **No Direct Antisemitic Content**: The phrase itself does not contain any language that directly aligns with examples of antisemitism outlined in the IHRA definition. There is no mention of Jews being blamed for societal issues, conspiracy theories about Jewish control, comparisons to Nazis, denial of the Holocaust, or other forms of hatred or discrimination based on ethnicity.

3. **Potential Interpretations**: If this tweet were part of a larger discussion, it could be interpreted in multiple ways:
   - It might express a benign view comparing Israel to a home environment.
   - In another context, if used metaphorically in a negative way about Israelis or Jewish people, further details would still be needed to determine antisemitism.

4. **No Manifestation of Antisemitic Beliefs**: The tweet does not manifest any antisemitic beliefs such as dehumanization, stereotypes, or attributions of collective blame. 

Therefore, based on the content of the tweet alone and without additional context that might clarify intent or meaning, it cannot be definitively classified as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",Yes,"To determine whether the tweet ""@trainersandtea @pip_davies Israel at home weren’t it?"" is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze its content in light of the guidelines provided.

The tweet itself appears truncated or incomplete, making interpretation challenging. However, assuming a possible context based on similar phrases used historically, such as ""send them back where they came from,"" the phrase could potentially be interpreted in an antisemitic manner depending on context and intent. This is because:

1. **Coded Language (Guideline 4):** Phrases like ""at home weren't it?"" can be coded language that suggests Jews should return to Israel or another homeland, echoing anti-Jewish sentiments where Jews are not seen as rightful inhabitants of their current country. Such statements have historically been used in a derogatory manner toward Jewish communities.

2. **Collective Responsibility (Guideline 7):** The phrase may imply collective responsibility by treating all individuals identified as ""Jews"" or associated with Israel as being responsible for actions attributed to the state, thus indirectly attributing negative characteristics or actions of a nation-state to an entire ethnic or religious group.

3. **Denial of Rights (Guideline 10):** If interpreted as suggesting Jews should not live in their current country, it could be seen as denying them the right to exist and flourish in that country, violating the principle of equality outlined in the guidelines.

Due to these potential implications, even if unintentional or without explicit malice, such language can contribute to an antisemitic narrative. Therefore, under the JDA definition, the tweet is considered antisemitic because it could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discriminatory attitudes toward Jews as a group. Contextual factors would be important for a definitive assessment but based on the content alone, these interpretations make the tweet fall within the boundaries of antisemitism as defined by JDA.",0,1,0,1,0,0

This tweet does not explicitly target Jews as individuals or Jewish people as a collective group with hatred. Instead, it critiques what is perceived as an unjust stance by the state of Israel in its diplomatic dealings.

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves perceptions and actions that manifest hate toward Jews, often involving dehumanizing stereotypes or attributing malicious intent collectively to Jewish people. Key aspects include accusations of a Jewish conspiracy, denial of the Holocaust, applying double standards uniquely to Israel (the ""Starter Pack"" items), or holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

While the tweet could be seen as an example of criticism directed at Israeli policy, and it employs satire that might be interpreted as exaggeration, it does not fit neatly into any of these antisemitic categories. It lacks elements such as demonizing allegations about Jewish people as a collective or attributing malicious intent to Jews based on their identity.

The IHRA definition acknowledges that legitimate criticism of Israel should not automatically be regarded as antisemitic, provided it is similar in nature to criticism directed at other countries and does not invoke classic antisemitic themes. In this case, the tweet appears to fall within the realm of political satire about a state's actions rather than an attack on Jewish people or Judaism.

Therefore, while some may find the joke offensive depending on their perspective on Israeli policy, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as outlined by the IHRA definition.",Yes,"** The tweet in question uses humor and satire to make light of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process by suggesting an absurdly unfair offer from Israel. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews, or Jewish institutions as Jewish.

In this tweet, the suggestion that Israel is offering ""3 soggy socks"" with one having a mustard stain—implying a grossly inadequate and disrespectful proposal—can be seen as an indirect form of prejudice or hostility. This aligns with guideline 2 from section A in the JDA definition, which discusses the notion of Jews being linked to negative forces, such as dishonesty or manipulation, within anti-Jewish fantasies.

The tweet caricatures Israel, implying it is behaving unreasonably and deceitfully in its dealings with Palestinians. By extension, given the close cultural and historical associations between Jewish identity and Israel, this can be interpreted as prejudicial against Jews themselves. It taps into negative stereotypes about Jewish cunning or unfairness without directly referencing Jewish people globally.

Furthermore, guideline 4 addresses antisemitism that is indirect or coded. While the tweet does not mention Jews explicitly, it uses a metaphor involving Israel that could perpetuate harmful stereotypes about Jewish behavior and intentions.

Thus, considering these aspects of the JDA definition, the tweet can be seen as engaging in indirect or coded antisemitic expression by promoting negative stereotypes associated with Jewish identity through its portrayal of Israeli actions.",0,1,0,1,0,0

In this context, whether a tweet is antisemitic depends on its content and implications within the broader discourse it engages with. 

1. **Targeting Israel**: The tweet mentions ""Israel, Blamed for George Floyd’s Death,"" which could imply that there are accusations directed at Israel or Jews in general for an event unrelated to them. If such blame is presented without evidence and suggests a conspiracy or collective responsibility of Jews (or Israelis) for the death of George Floyd, it could fall under the antisemitic category as described by IHRA, specifically where allegations or stereotypes about Jews controlling societal institutions are made.

2. **Conspiracy Allegations**: One key element in determining antisemitism is whether there are ""mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations"" against Jews. If the tweet implies such unfounded allegations, it might be considered antisemitic.

3. **Context and Implication**: The IHRA definition emphasizes context. Therefore, understanding the full context of the tweet (such as additional content in the linked article or preceding discourse) is crucial to accurately assess whether it aligns with any listed manifestations of antisemitism.

4. **Replying to Calumniators**: If Israel's response addresses false accusations and clarifies misunderstandings without engaging in rhetoric that could be construed as stereotyping Jews or Israelis, it might not be antisemitic.

Without further context about the full content and implications of the tweet and linked material, a definitive judgment cannot be made. The assessment would require careful analysis of how Israel is portrayed and whether the communication perpetuates harmful stereotypes or unfounded allegations against Jews.",Yes,"The tweet in question implies that Israel is being blamed for the death of George Floyd, an incident unrelated to Israeli actions or policies and which occurred in the United States.

By implying a collective Jewish responsibility or linking Jews to unrelated global events in this manner, the tweet may evoke age-old antisemitic conspiracy theories that suggest Jewish control or involvement beyond their actual influence.

Moreover, guideline B7 mentions holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct as an example of antisemitism. The implication that Jews globally are being blamed for George Floyd’s death due to their association with Israel can be seen as attributing collective responsibility to Jews simply because they are Jewish.

There is some black in the pulses.,No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly target Jews or Jewish individuals; instead, it mentions the death of a Chinese ambassador following a visit by the US Secretary of State to Israel. The tweet suggests a connection between these events but lacks any direct reference to Jews or antisemitic stereotypes. To determine if this is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we would need evidence that:

1. **Targets Jews or Jewish Institutions**: There is no mention of Jews or Jewish people in the tweet.

2. **Manifestations of Antisemitism**: The tweet does not use any language or imagery commonly associated with antisemitism, such as conspiracy theories about Jewish control, blood libel, or comparisons to Nazis concerning Israeli policy.

3. **Criticism of Israel**: While the tweet mentions Israel, criticism of a country itself, including Israel, is not inherently antisemitic unless it employs antisemitic stereotypes or language (such as equating contemporary Israeli policy with Nazi actions).

4. **Conspiracy Theories**: There is no mention of Jewish conspiracies or false allegations about Jews controlling societal institutions.

5. **Holocaust Denial**: The tweet does not deny, distort, or trivialize the Holocaust in any way.

The primary focus of the tweet appears to be on geopolitical speculation rather than an attack on Jewish people or Israel grounded in antisemitic rhetoric. Thus, based on the available information and applying the IHRA definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic. However, context can matter significantly, so additional context might alter this analysis if it revealed underlying antisemitic intent.",Yes,"The tweet in question contains language that can be interpreted as antisemitic under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Specifically, it implies a causal link between the visit of the US Secretary of State to Israel and the death of the Chinese ambassador. This type of statement aligns with guideline 2 of the JDA, which identifies a core aspect of classic antisemitism as associating Jews or Jewish institutions with malicious forces or conspiracies.

The tweet suggests that events involving Israel can have hidden, harmful effects, akin to the antisemitic fantasy where ""the Jews"" are believed to wield secret and detrimental influence over global affairs. By insinuating that a visit to Israel led directly to someone's death, it echoes themes of conspiracy and malevolence often associated with classic antisemitic narratives.

Furthermore, this type of coded language fits guideline 4, which states that antisemitism can be indirect or coded. The tweet does not explicitly mention Jews but implies negative consequences stemming from an association with Israel, thereby potentially racializing or stigmatizing Jews by extension due to the linkage between ""the State of Israel"" and alleged harmful actions.

In conclusion, while the tweet might not directly refer to Jewish individuals or communities, its implication of a nefarious link involving Israel can be interpreted as perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes under the JDA framework. Thus, it is considered antisemitic according to these guidelines.",0,1,0,1,0,0

According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, criticism of Israeli policies or its leaders that is similar to that leveled against other countries or their leaders does not constitute antisemitism.

The tweet uses derogatory language directed at Netanyahu personally and calls for a vote in favor of his political opponent. This type of political expression, while harsh and potentially offensive due to the language used, does not specifically target Jewish people or attribute negative actions or characteristics to them as a collective group. It focuses on political dissatisfaction with an individual rather than making allegations or employing stereotypes against Jews.

Moreover, there is no indication in the tweet that it links Netanyahu's political position to his identity as a Jew in a way that suggests harmful intentions toward Jewish people collectively. The language does not fall into categories such as accusing Jews of conspiracies, denying historical facts like the Holocaust, or applying double standards uniquely against Jews.

In summary, while the tone and choice of words in the tweet may be deemed aggressive or offensive by some due to its personal attacks on Netanyahu, they do not align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism since there is no evidence that Jewish individuals or communities are being targeted based on their identity.",Yes,"The tweet in question contains language that targets and attacks Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu personally, using derogatory terms such as ""Disgusting Greedy Corrupted MYSOGANISTIC Pig."" While criticism of a political figure is not inherently antisemitic, the use of such inflammatory language can be seen as contributing to an environment where Jews or Jewish individuals are subject to hostility and dehumanization.

According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). In this case, Netanyahu is a prominent Jewish leader, and the language used in the tweet has the potential to reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews, such as greed and corruption, which can be seen as drawing on classic antisemitic tropes. 

Furthermore, targeting a Jewish political figure using such hostile language could be interpreted as indirectly applying negative stereotypes or hostility towards Jews more broadly, especially when viewed through the lens of historical patterns of antisemitism that involve demonizing Jewish leaders.

Additionally, although the tweet explicitly calls for political change and does not directly mention Jews in general, the context in which it is made—targeting a Jewish leader with hostile language—could contribute to an environment where Jews or those associated with Israel are viewed through a lens of prejudice. The JDA acknowledges that antisemitism can manifest indirectly and through coded language, making this tweet potentially antisemitic due to its tone and the stereotypes it implicitly endorses.

Therefore, considering these factors within the framework provided by the JDA, the tweet can be considered antisemitic due to its hostile language and the potential reinforcement of negative stereotypes about Jews.",0,1,0,1,0,0

1. **""Celebrates Jeremiah Wright""**: Jeremiah Wright is a pastor known for his controversial sermons about race relations in America. The celebration or critique of his views does not inherently relate to antisemitic beliefs or actions as outlined by the IHRA definition, unless it involves antisemitic rhetoric specifically directed at Jews.

2. **""Praises Louis Farrakhan""**: Louis Farrakhan is known for making statements that have been widely criticized as antisemitic, including calling Judaism a ""gutter religion."" However, simply praising Farrakhan does not automatically equate to endorsing his antisemitic views unless the praise explicitly supports or reiterates those specific views.

3. **""Calls Israel an 'apartheid state'""**: According to the IHRA definition, criticism of Israeli government policy is not considered antisemitic when it resembles that leveled against any other country and does not rely on stereotypes or negative character traits associated with Jews. Critiquing the policies of a nation-state does not inherently imply antisemitism unless it employs classic antisemitic motifs or holds all Jews collectively responsible for actions of Israel.

The tweet criticizes Reverend Warnock by associating him with certain figures and describing his stance on Israel, but it doesn't directly engage in rhetoric that fits the IHRA's examples of antisemitic manifestations. The claim that he calls Israel an ""apartheid state"" could be seen as legitimate criticism depending on context, rather than inherently antisemitic.

Therefore, based solely on the information provided in the tweet, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the IHRA definition.",Yes,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet in question accuses Reverend Warnock of embracing rhetoric that is described as ""disgusting anti-American, anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel."" To assess whether this aligns with the JDA definition of antisemitism, we need to analyze the elements mentioned in the tweet:

1. **Celebrates Jeremiah Wright**: Rev. Jeremiah Wright has been controversial due to past statements perceived as critical towards Israel. However, celebrating him is not inherently antisemitic under the JDA unless it specifically involves or promotes classic antisemitic themes (e.g., linking Jews with evil).

2. **Praises Louis Farrakhan**: Louis Farrakhan has made statements that have been widely criticized for containing antisemitic elements, such as conspiracy theories about Jewish influence and control. Praising Farrakhan can be seen as supporting or endorsing these views.

3. **Calls Israel an “apartheid state”**: This phrase is contentious. According to the JDA guidelines, criticizing Israel's policies or comparing it to apartheid is not inherently antisemitic (guideline 13). However, if this critique involves applying classic antisemitic stereotypes or suggests that Jews as a collective are responsible for the actions of the State of Israel, it could be coded antisemitism (guidelines 4 and 7).

In this context, while calling Israel an ""apartheid state"" is not automatically antisemitic per JDA guidelines, praising Louis Farrakhan involves endorsing known antisemitic views. Furthermore, linking these criticisms with general anti-American sentiment suggests a possible underlying hostility against Jewish institutions or figures who support Israel.

Thus, the tweet promotes rhetoric associated with recognized antisemitic themes and individuals, making it consistent with antisemitism as defined by JDA.",0,1,0,1,0,0

To determine whether this is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we need to analyze its content against the criteria outlined by the IHRA.

1. **Targeting of Jews or Jewish Collectivity**: The tweet references Israel but does not specifically target Jews as individuals or a group. It mentions the United States and Israel without directly associating them with antisemitic themes such as conspiracy theories, stereotypes, or blaming Jews for broader societal issues.

2. **Condemnation or Criticism of Israel**: According to the IHRA definition, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. The tweet mentions ""these stuff happens more in US and Israel,"" which does not inherently indicate an antisemitic bias unless contextually linked to harmful stereotypes or accusations specifically targeting Jews.

3. **Use of Stereotypes or Allegations**: The IHRA definition highlights the importance of identifying mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews. This tweet lacks such language; it does not make any specific false claims or negative characterizations about Jewish people as a group.

4. **Holocaust Denial or Minimization**: There is no mention or implication related to Holocaust denial or minimization in this tweet.

5. **Double Standards or Collective Blame**: The tweet makes no direct comparison between Israel and Nazi Germany, nor does it apply double standards that single out Israel unfairly compared to other nations.

6. **Other Factors**: The final part of the tweet mentions a personal note about someone's mother being an alcoholic. This statement appears unrelated to any discussion on antisemitism and seems more like a personal insult rather than an expression targeting Jewish individuals or communities.

In summary, while the tweet mentions Israel alongside the US without providing context, it does not meet the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it lacks harmful stereotypes, false allegations, or collective blame directed at Jews. Therefore, based on the content alone and according to the IHRA criteria, this tweet is not considered antisemitic. However, context can be crucial in fully assessing intent and impact, which might alter such an analysis if additional information were provided.",Yes,"The tweet in question makes several statements that can be considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines. Here's a breakdown based on the JDA:

1. **Indirect and Contextual Hostility**: Although not explicitly directed at Jews, the context of comparing occurrences ""in US and Israel"" could imply an indirect form of hostility or prejudice against Jews by linking them to negative conditions without evidence. The tweet plays into stereotypes and assumptions that can be instrumentalized in antisemitic rhetoric.

2. **Coded Language**: By mentioning both the US and Israel together, particularly when discussing negative events or circumstances (""these stuff happens more in US and Israel""), the tweet might suggest a coded message associating Jews (and by extension, Israel) with negativity. This aligns with guideline 4 from JDA about antisemitism being indirect or coded.

3. **Stereotyping**: The tweet further includes a personal attack that could be interpreted as stereotypical (""chances are you wouldn't even be here if your mom wasn't an alcoholic""). While not directly related to Jews, the tone and nature of such comments can contribute to a hostile environment where antisemitism may thrive or be tolerated.

4. **Linking to Broader Negative Themes**: The tweet connects Israel with problematic issues without evidence or context, which might suggest that ""the Jews"" are responsible for negative phenomena, aligning with guideline 2 from JDA about linking Jews with forces of evil or conspiracy theories.

In summary, the combination of indirect hostility, potential coded language, and stereotyping in a context that includes Israel contributes to an antisemitic implication according to the JDA guidelines.",0,1,0,1,0,0

According to the IHRA, antisemitism involves a certain perception of Jews expressed as hatred or hostility, which can manifest in various forms such as rhetorical attacks, physical violence, or discrimination against Jewish individuals, property, institutions, or symbols.

1. **Lack of Context**: The tweet is very brief and lacks explicit content that directly relates to the examples provided by the IHRA definition. It does not contain any language or imagery that overtly targets Jews with hatred, employs stereotypes, or engages in conspiracy theories about Jewish control or behavior.

2. **Ambiguity of Terms**: Without additional context, it's unclear what ""cradily"" refers to, and whether this term has a known connection to antisemitic rhetoric or actions. The tweet could be interpreted in many ways depending on the broader context or prior communications from the account.

3. **Insufficient Evidence of Hostility or Conspiracy**: The IHRA definition emphasizes specific types of accusations such as conspiracies about Jewish control, demonization, and dehumanizing stereotypes. There is no clear evidence of these elements within the tweet itself.

4. **Potential Misinterpretation**: Any judgment about whether a statement is antisemitic should consider the intent behind it, the audience's perception, and any relevant historical or cultural context that might lend it an antisemitic tone.

In conclusion, without more information on what ""@witchmaestra"" intends to convey with this tweet, particularly concerning ""cradily,"" it cannot be definitively classified as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. More context would be necessary for a thorough evaluation.",Yes,"The tweet ""@witchmaestra israel and cradily"" can be interpreted as potentially antisemitic based on the guidelines provided by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The key issue here lies in understanding what ""cradily"" might mean or imply, which is not immediately clear from the text alone. 

1. **Potential for Code and Context**: According to JDA's guideline 4, antisemitism can be direct or indirect, explicit or coded. If ""cradily"" refers to a derogatory term associated with stereotypes or conspiracy theories about Jewish people, such as involvement in global financial manipulation or control (similar to the ""Rothschilds control the world"" example), then it could be seen as a coded antisemitic statement.

2. **Interpretation of Content**: If ""cradily"" is a term that historically links Jews with negative stereotypes or conspiracy theories, associating Israel and this term together might imply an antisemitic sentiment, even if not explicitly stated.

3. **Contextual Analysis**: The determination of whether the tweet is antisemitic would heavily depend on additional context surrounding the tweet. If there's a pattern in ""@witchmaestra’s"" posts that suggests bias or prejudice against Jews or Israel linked to historical stereotypes, then it further supports an interpretation as antisemitic.

4. **No Direct Evidence**: Without explicit clarification from the author of what ""cradily"" means, any interpretation must be tentative. However, the potential for a coded message justifies caution in assessing this as possibly antisemitic under JDA guidelines.

In conclusion, while not definitively clear without further context or explanation of the term ""cradily,"" the association between Israel and an ambiguous negative term can reasonably raise concerns under the JDA's definition of antisemitism due to its potential for coded language linking Jews with harmful stereotypes.

1. **Antisemitism Definition**: According to the IHRA, antisemitism involves certain perceptions or expressions directed towards Jews, which may manifest as hatred, conspiratorial allegations, blaming Jews for societal problems, denying the Holocaust, and other forms of discrimination linked specifically to Jewish identity.

2. **Content Analysis**:
   - The tweet includes a statement ""Openly hates Jews."" This is a direct expression of animosity toward Jews, which aligns with the IHRA's description of antisemitism as involving hatred directed at Jewish individuals.
   - However, the context of this statement within a broader list of general criticisms towards various groups (including non-Jewish entities like atheists and America) complicates its characterization solely as antisemitic. The tweet does not include specific elements like conspiratorial allegations against Jews, denial of the Holocaust, or comparisons involving Israel and Nazism, which are central to IHRA's examples.

3. **Conclusion**: While the statement ""Openly hates Jews"" is indeed an expression of hatred toward Jews, without additional context suggesting a broader antisemitic agenda (such as conspiracy theories or demonization related specifically to Jewish identity), it does not fully meet all the criteria outlined in the IHRA definition for antisemitism. Therefore, while it contains elements that could be considered part of antisemitic rhetoric, based on this single tweet alone, it is insufficient to categorically label the entire content as antisemitic under the IHRA's guidelines.

In summary, although there is an expression of hatred toward Jews in the tweet, without additional context or specific antisemitic examples, it cannot be definitively categorized as antisemitic according to the comprehensive criteria set by the IHRA.",Yes,"** The tweet in question expresses open hatred toward Jews and lists various other groups it claims to hate, including gays, atheists, Christians, and America. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is defined as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews, or Jewish institutions as Jewish.

1. **Hostility toward Jews:** The tweet explicitly states ""Openly hates Jews."" This clear expression of animosity aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as it involves direct hostility towards an individual group—Jews—in this case.

2. **Contextualizing Hostility:** While the tweet also mentions other groups and broad ideological critiques, such as support for Sharia law and funding from organizations like CAIR (Council on American-Islamic Relations), these points are not directly relevant to assessing whether it is antisemitic under JDA guidelines. The presence of hostility towards Jews within the text suffices to categorize it as antisemitic.

3. **No Justification Needed:** The tweet does not provide any specific context or reasoning for its hatred, which aligns with classical forms of antisemitism that often include baseless accusations and broad negative generalizations about Jewish people.

Therefore, based on the JDA's definition, the tweet is antisemitic due to its explicit expression of hostility towards Jews.",0,1,0,1,0,0

The IHRA definition of antisemitism includes various manifestations such as making dehumanizing or stereotypical allegations about Jews, accusing Jews collectively for actions of any individual Jewish person, and employing sinister stereotypes. The tweet suggests a response to the statement ""You don’t look Jewish,"" which can be perceived as minimizing the experience or perceptions that individuals have regarding their identity and how they are seen by others.

The tweet uses wordplay on the concept of antisemitism itself, suggesting that if someone does not ""look antisemitic,"" it negates any potential negative implications tied to them not looking stereotypically Jewish. This type of humor can be seen as dismissive of genuine concerns about identity and prejudice but doesn't directly align with the IHRA definition's examples of antisemitism.

The tweet does not make dehumanizing, demonizing, or conspiratorial claims about Jews, nor does it deny historical facts like the Holocaust, blame Jews collectively for actions done by non-Jews, or apply double standards to Israel. Instead, it appears to be a satirical comment on identity perceptions and possibly prejudice but lacks the hateful intent or harmful rhetoric defined in IHRA's antisemitism definition.

However, it is important to note that while not antisemitic per se under the IHRA criteria, such tweets could contribute to a dismissive attitude towards legitimate concerns about discrimination or identity. In sensitive discussions around race, ethnicity, and religion, even humor can sometimes perpetuate stereotypes or trivialize serious issues. Therefore, context and intent are crucial in fully understanding and evaluating the implications of such statements.",Yes,"The tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the guidelines provided in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Inherent Stereotyping and Prejudice**: The tweet promotes a stereotype that being ""antisemitic"" is something that should visibly manifest in one’s appearance, which can essentialize antisemitism as a trait that can be easily discerned from someone's looks. This aligns with guideline A.1 regarding the racialization of traits or behaviors.

2. **Promoting Hostility**: By suggesting that not appearing ""antisemitic"" is the only acceptable response to questioning one's Jewish identity, it implicitly fosters an adversarial and hostile environment for Jews, implying that they must defend themselves against suspicion of antisemitism based on appearance.

3. **Indirect Antisemitism**: Although not explicitly hateful, the tweet indirectly engages with coded language by suggesting a connection between appearance and moral character (i.e., being ""antisemitic""). This can be seen as instrumentalizing stereotypes about Jews in a way that aligns with guideline A.4 regarding indirect or coded forms of antisemitism.

4. **Collective Responsibility**: The advice given to Jews implies they must collectively respond in a specific manner when confronted about their identity, echoing guideline B.7 where Jews are held collectively responsible for issues related to Israel’s conduct, though here it is applied more broadly to any interaction questioning Jewishness.

Overall, the tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes and fosters an environment of hostility towards Jews by linking appearance with antisemitism in a way that devalues individual identity and promotes suspicion. Thus, under JDA guidelines, this can be considered antisemitic.",0,1,0,1,0,0

The tweet in question states that ""stories of Jews getting attacked in Brooklyn not getting widely covered is not a case of the wrong victims, but of the perpetrators who are inconvenient to an establishment media narrative."" To determine if this tweet falls under the IHRA definition of antisemitism, we need to analyze its content against the examples and guidelines provided by the IHRA.

1. **Expression of Concern:** The tweet expresses concern about violence against Jews in Brooklyn not receiving adequate media coverage. This indicates a focus on ensuring justice or attention for victims of an attack, which is neither inherently negative nor antisemitic. 

2. **Critique of Media Practices:** It criticizes the media for potentially overlooking stories based on perceived narrative convenience rather than truth or importance. Criticism of media practices does not inherently target Jews or Judaism and can apply to any group or issue.

3. **No Demonization or Stereotyping:** The tweet does not employ stereotypes, dehumanizing language, or false accusations about Jews as a collective. It avoids the kinds of statements outlined by IHRA such as conspiracy theories, denial of historical events, or comparisons that demean Jewish people or institutions.

4. **Contextual Analysis:** While it mentions ""perpetrators"" being inconvenient to media narratives, this is not directed specifically at Jews but rather addresses an issue with how media might cover stories involving Jewish victims. Without additional context implying bias against Jews beyond the specific coverage of attacks on them, there is no indication that this critique equates to antisemitism.

5. **No Condemnation or Harm:** There are no calls for harm, discrimination, or conspiracy theories directed at Jews in the tweet. The criticism is aimed at a perceived failure by the media rather than an attack on Jewish people.

In conclusion, while the tweet raises issues about media coverage of crimes against Jews, it does not contain elements that align with antisemitic definitions as per the IHRA working definition. Therefore, the answer is ""No,"" this tweet is not antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet in question suggests that stories of Jews being attacked are not widely covered because the perpetrators are ""inconvenient to an establishment media narrative."" This statement can be analyzed under several guidelines of the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) as follows:

1. **Instrumentalization and Conspiracy Theory**: The notion that there is a deliberate suppression of information due to its inconvenience to certain narratives aligns with the idea of a conspiracy theory, which is highlighted in JDA guideline 2. This suggests an underlying manipulation by powerful entities, reminiscent of the antisemitic trope that ""the Jews"" control or manipulate media and governments for their own ends.

2. **Contextual Judgement**: According to guideline 4, identifying coded speech often requires context and judgement. The tweet implies a hidden agenda by the media, which could be interpreted as a modern echo of age-old conspiracy theories about Jewish power structures. While it does not directly accuse Jews or Jewish institutions, it indirectly contributes to a narrative where Jewish-related issues are seen as selectively highlighted based on ulterior motives.

3. **Indirect Hostility**: The tweet subtly suggests that the media's lack of coverage is purposeful and malicious, which can foster an environment of distrust towards Jewish communities when they report such incidents. This aligns with the indirect forms of antisemitism described in guideline 4.

In conclusion, while the tweet does not explicitly use antisemitic language or imagery, its implications fit into patterns recognized by JDA as potentially antisemitic due to their resonance with classic anti-Jewish conspiracy theories and manipulations. Thus, it can be reasonably considered antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines.",0,1,0,1,0,0

Palestinian are Egyptians and other Arabs that chosen to stay, after losing the 6 day war.",No,"The tweet in question states that Palestinians did not exist before Israel was established and suggests they are Egyptians or other Arabs who chose to stay after the 1967 Six-Day War. This statement, while potentially misleading or controversial regarding historical interpretations of Palestinian history, does not align directly with the IHRA working definition of antisemitism.

The IHRA definition outlines various manifestations of antisemitism, primarily focusing on expressions that target Jews as a people or involve harmful stereotypes and accusations against them. These include blaming Jews for societal issues, denying the Holocaust, holding Jewish citizens collectively responsible for actions of Israel, among others.

In this tweet, there are no direct references to Jews or Israelis that would fall under the IHRA definition's examples of antisemitism. The content does not express hatred toward Jews, nor does it employ stereotypes about Jews conspiring to harm humanity or blame them for wrongdoing. It also doesn't involve accusations against Jews related to the Holocaust or deny their right to self-determination.

While the tweet might be viewed as controversial in terms of its historical claims and could contribute to a broader narrative that some may find problematic, it does not specifically target Jewish people or Israel in a manner that aligns with the IHRA's examples of antisemitic acts. Therefore, according to the provided definition, this specific tweet is not considered antisemitic. However, discussions on such topics should be approached carefully to avoid exacerbating tensions between different groups and promoting understanding.",Yes,"**

The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) for several reasons:

1. **Historical Denial and Misrepresentation**: The statement that ""Palestinian didn't exist before Israel was given to the Jews after WWII"" is a misrepresentation of historical facts. Palestinians have long-standing roots in the region, predating the establishment of Israel. Denying this history can contribute to an environment where Jewish claims are seen as more legitimate than Palestinian ones, which aligns with antisemitic narratives that devalue or deny the rights and existence of Jews.

2. **Implicit Hostility**: By stating that Palestinians were ""chosen to stay"" after losing the 1967 Six-Day War, the tweet implies that their presence is merely a choice rather than a result of historical continuity and complex socio-political factors. This can be seen as part of an effort to delegitimize Palestinian claims and existence in the region.

3. **Linking to Broader Antisemitic Narratives**: While the tweet does not directly attack Jews or Jewish institutions, it indirectly supports narratives that are often associated with antisemitism, such as denying Jewish historical connections to the land. By framing Israel's establishment as a straightforward gift from the British and dismissing Palestinian history, it echoes broader antisemitic themes of questioning the legitimacy of Jewish claims.

4. **Potential for Instrumentalization**: The tweet could be used to fuel antisemitic sentiments by reinforcing stereotypes or narratives that Jews have undue influence or are responsible for displacing other peoples. This aligns with guideline 2 in the JDA, which discusses the idea of Jews being linked to forces perceived as evil or unjust.

In summary, while the tweet does not directly express antisemitism, it contains elements that can contribute to an environment where Jewish history and rights are delegitimized, fitting within the broader framework of antisemitic ideologies as outlined by the JDA.",0,1,0,1,0,0

It then comments on the frequency of protests against Christians. To determine whether this constitutes antisemitism according to the IHRA definition, we need to examine several aspects:

1. **Perception and Expression**: The tweet does not express hatred toward Jews per se; it makes a general statement about religions and their perceived stance on LGBT issues.

2. **Targeting of Jewish Individuals or Institutions**: There is no direct targeting of Jewish individuals, non-Jewish individuals associated with Jews, Jewish community institutions, or religious facilities. The tweet mentions businesses owned by Muslims or Jews in a hypothetical context without identifying specific entities.

3. **Conspiracy and Stereotyping**: The tweet does not employ conspiratorial language about Jews controlling societal elements, nor does it use demonizing or dehumanizing stereotypes against Jews. It discusses perceived actions (or lack thereof) regarding LGBT issues broadly across two religions.

4. **Blame or Double Standards**: While the author mentions a desire for protests similar to those against Christians, this does not inherently place blame on Jewish people as a collective nor applies double standards in a manner defined by the IHRA examples.

5. **Denial of Holocaust and Other Specific Antisemitic Acts**: The tweet makes no mention or implication related to Holocaust denial, exaggeration, or any other specific antisemitic acts outlined by the IHRA definition.

In summary, while the tweet could be seen as insensitive due to its generalization about religious groups, it does not align with the IHRA's detailed criteria for what constitutes antisemitism. It lacks the elements of hatred, harmful intent, conspiracy theories, or stereotyping specific to Jews that are necessary under the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet in question displays several elements that align with the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition of antisemitism. Let's analyze it according to the provided guidelines:

1. **Sweeping Generalizations**: The tweet makes sweeping negative generalizations about Jews by implying that they, as a group defined by their religion or ethnicity, are not ""pro LGBT."" This aligns with guideline A.1, which notes that making sweeping negative generalizations is characteristic of antisemitism.

2. **Linkage to Evil or Negative Stereotypes**: The tweet indirectly links Jews to negative stereotypes by implying they should be targeted for protest in the same manner as companies owned by Christians (who are implicitly suggested to oppose LGBT rights). This can be seen as an instrumentalization of prejudice, aligning with guideline A.2, which warns against linking ""the Jews"" to negative characteristics or forces.

3. **Coded Language**: The tweet uses coded language that could be interpreted as antisemitic in context. It suggests action should be taken against Jewish-owned companies without directly expressing hatred but instead by insinuating a collective responsibility for an assumed characteristic (being not pro-LGBT). This aligns with guideline A.4, which discusses the use of indirect or coded language to express antisemitic ideas.

Overall, while the tweet does not explicitly call for violence or use overtly hostile language, it perpetuates negative stereotypes and generalizations about Jews, fitting within the broader framework of antisemitism as defined by the JDA guidelines.

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Expression of Hatred**: The tweet conveys disappointment or sorrow rather than hatred toward Jewish people.

2. **Manifestations Directed at Jews or Their Institutions**: There is no indication that individuals, property, community institutions, or religious facilities linked to Jewish people are targeted in this statement.

3. **Conspiracy or Blame**: It does not suggest any conspiracy involving Jews or blame them for current events or societal issues.

4. **Denial of the Holocaust**: The tweet does not deny, minimize, or distort the Holocaust or its historical facts.

5. **Accusations Toward Jewish People or Israel**: There are no accusations made against Jews as a people or collective responsibility placed on them regarding actions by individuals or nations like Israel.

6. **Double Standards or Collective Responsibility**: It doesn't apply double standards to Israel that aren’t applied elsewhere, nor does it hold the entire Jewish community responsible for actions of non-Jews.

7. **Use of Stereotypes and Symbols**: The tweet does not employ classic antisemitic symbols or stereotypes in its message.

8. **Criminal Acts and Discrimination**: There is no criminal act or discrimination against Jews mentioned or implied.

While the sentiment expressed concerns historical events related to anti-Jewish actions, it does not cross into antisemitism according to the IHRA definition because it lacks any expression of hatred, demonization, or collective blame toward Jewish people.",Yes,"**

The tweet in question references ""Church’s with a name of someone who directly contributed to the death of Jews."" To determine if this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze it against the provided guidelines.

1. **Guideline 2** discusses how classic antisemitism involves portraying Jews as linked to evil forces, and includes references to historical actions by individuals that have contributed to Jewish suffering or death. The mention of someone who ""directly contributed to the death of Jews"" likely refers to figures like Christopher Columbus, whose expeditions led to significant violence against indigenous peoples including Jews in Spain.

2. **Guideline 1** emphasizes avoiding essentializing or making sweeping negative generalizations about a population. While this guideline focuses more on racial generalizations, the tweet could be interpreted as indirectly applying historical antisemitic ideas by perpetuating a narrative that associates Jewish suffering with figures who have been controversially linked to such events.

3. **Guideline 5** addresses Holocaust denial or minimization, which is not directly relevant here since the tweet does not deny or minimize the Holocaust specifically but rather references historical contributions to anti-Jewish violence more broadly.

The tweet appears to evoke a negative association with Jews and uses the historical context of persecution as part of its argument. Although it doesn't explicitly use antisemitic language or imagery, by referencing someone who contributed to Jewish deaths in a church's name, it could indirectly perpetuate harmful stereotypes or narratives about collective Jewish suffering. This can be seen as contributing to an environment that supports antisemitic ideas.

Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, this tweet can be considered antisemitic due to its implicit association of Jews with historical victimization and by potentially reinforcing negative perceptions related to such historical events.",0,1,0,1,0,0

The tweet in question states that ""People of color have been saying...that the Trump election was about white supremacy"" and expresses sadness that Jews, Muslims, Hispanics, among others, were victims of violence. It does not contain elements explicitly outlined by the IHRA definition of antisemitism.

1. **Conspiracy Allegations:** The tweet makes no claims about a Jewish conspiracy or control over societal institutions.
   
2. **Blaming Jews for Actions:** There is no accusation that Jews are collectively responsible for any wrongdoing, nor does it blame them for actions committed by others.

3. **Denial of the Holocaust:** The statement does not deny or trivialize the Holocaust in any way.

4. **Double Standards and Comparison to Nazis:** It does not apply double standards to Israel or compare contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.

5. **Collective Responsibility:** There is no indication that Jews are being held collectively responsible for actions unrelated to them, such as those pertaining to the state of Israel.

The tweet appears to be a reflection on racial violence and mentions various groups (Jews in synagogues, Muslims in mosques) who have suffered from hate crimes. It emphasizes the need to discuss racism without directly accusing or demeaning Jews or attributing antisemitic characteristics as defined by IHRA. The context suggests it is discussing issues of white supremacy rather than expressing hatred toward Jewish people.

In conclusion, while the tweet mentions synagogues and Jews among other groups affected by violence, it does not embody the elements specified in the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Therefore, based on the provided information, the tweet is not antisemitic according to that definition.",Yes,"**

The tweet in question suggests that the deaths of Jews in synagogues were necessary to advance a debate on Trump's alleged racism and white supremacy. This can be interpreted as linking Jewish individuals and institutions (i.e., synagogues) with political discourse or agendas, which aligns with guideline 7 from the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). According to this guideline, holding Jews collectively responsible for issues unrelated to their actions or attributing specific political or social outcomes to them can be considered antisemitic.

Furthermore, by placing Jewish deaths in the context of advancing a debate about white supremacy—a topic tied to broader societal and racial discussions—the tweet might imply that such tragedies are justifiable means to an end. This implication could be seen as diminishing the severity and significance of violence against Jews, indirectly suggesting their instrumentalization for political gain.

While the tweet may not explicitly use traditional antisemitic tropes or language (as outlined in guidelines 2 and 3), its framing can contribute to harmful narratives that view Jewish suffering through a lens of utility rather than addressing it as an inherently condemnable act. This indirect association with negative outcomes, even if unintended, aligns with the JDA's understanding of antisemitism when considering context and potential instrumentalization (guideline 4). 

Therefore, based on these considerations, the tweet can be seen as antisemitic according to the criteria set by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism.",0,1,0,1,0,0

To determine if this is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we need to analyze its content against the provided criteria.

1. **Perception of Jews and Hatred**: The statement implies a perception involving two groups: ""gays"" and ""Jews."" However, it does not express hatred toward Jews but rather suggests an outcome (the appearance of the Messiah) if Jews are being hated by another group. There is no direct expression of animosity or negative stereotypes directed at Jews.

2. **Manifestations**: The IHRA examples include calls for harm, dehumanizing allegations, and conspiracy theories about Jews. This tweet does not contain any such elements. It doesn't call for harm, use derogatory language, or imply a Jewish conspiracy or other harmful stereotype.

3. **Context of Criticism or Harm**: The message is speculative and appears to be using religious sentiment humorously or metaphorically, rather than making an antisemitic accusation or statement. There's no indication of harmful intent towards Jews.

4. **Religious References**: While the tweet references a religious concept (the Messiah), it does so in a manner that seems more hypothetical or humorous rather than targeting Jewish people negatively. The IHRA definition includes misuse of religious symbols; however, this reference lacks the context of demonizing or dehumanizing intent required to classify it as antisemitic.

Overall, while sensitive language regarding any group should be approached with caution, this tweet does not fit the criteria for antisemitism according to the IHRA's definition. It lacks direct negative implications about Jews and doesn't perpetuate harmful stereotypes or incite hostility towards Jewish people.",Yes,"The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) due to several factors outlined in the guidelines. 

1. **Association with Evil and Hostility**: The tweet links a group of people (""the gays"") with ""hating Jews,"" which implicitly suggests that Jewish people are being subjected to prejudice or hostility. It also implies an element of conspiracy or animosity directed at Jews, reminiscent of classical antisemitic tropes where Jews are associated with negative forces.

2. **Coded Language and Context**: The tweet uses coded language by suggesting a connection between ""the gays hating Jews"" and the arrival of the Messiah. This can be interpreted as a way to indirectly convey hostility towards Jews or Jewish beliefs, which falls under the guideline that antisemitism can manifest in indirect or coded forms (Guideline 4). It relies on context and judgment to understand the implications behind such statements.

3. **Misuse of Religious Themes**: The mention of the Messiah's appearance as a consequence of ""the gays hating Jews"" can be interpreted as manipulating religious narratives for antisemitic purposes, further linking Jewish identity with negative outcomes or conspiracies, which is a hallmark of antisemitism (Guideline 2).

4. **Hostility and Prejudice**: The tweet could foster an environment where prejudice against Jews is justified or normalized by suggesting that their persecution would lead to significant religious consequences. This kind of rhetoric can contribute to discrimination and hostility against Jewish individuals based on stereotypes or unfounded accusations.

1. **Expression of Hatred**: The content does not express hatred toward Jews; instead, it references a historical event recognized as part of the Holocaust, which is a genocide targeting Jewish people among others. It doesn't exhibit any rhetoric that promotes harm or animosity towards Jewish individuals today.

2. **Mendacious or Dehumanizing Allegations**: There are no false or dehumanizing statements about Jews in general within this tweet. The information provided appears to be factual, relating to historical events rather than making unfounded claims against contemporary Jewish communities.

3. **Blame for Wrongdoing**: The tweet does not blame modern Jewish people or Israel for any actions; it discusses past atrocities committed during World War II by Nazi Germany and its allies.

4. **Denial of the Holocaust**: There is no denial of the Holocaust here; rather, it acknowledges a tragic aspect of it. The mention of the mass grave aligns with historical records and testimonies about the systematic extermination carried out in ghettos.

5. **Double Standards or Unjust Comparisons**: The tweet does not apply double standards to Israel nor draws comparisons between Israeli policies and Nazi actions, which are forms of antisemitism according to the IHRA definition.

6. **Use of Antisemitic Symbols or Imagery**: There is no use of imagery or symbols associated with classic antisemitism, such as blood libel or accusations related to religious texts like claims about Jews killing Jesus.

In conclusion, this tweet does not align with any of the examples or criteria for antisemitism as defined by the IHRA.

To evaluate whether this statement is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must consider several key aspects from its guidelines:

1. **Historical Accuracy and Holocaust Denial**: The JDA specifically identifies denying or minimizing the Holocaust as antisemitic, including claims about extermination camps or the number of victims that are false or misleading. This tweet does not explicitly deny the Holocaust but makes a specific historical claim regarding an event in Belarus.

2. **Verification of Claims**: For such a serious historical assertion to be credible, it must be supported by verifiable evidence. The claim made in the tweet appears unverified and lacks any immediate source for independent verification. Without substantiating evidence, promoting this as fact can spread misinformation, which is dangerous given its sensitive nature related to Holocaust history.

3. **Potential for Misinformation**: Even if not intended to deny or minimize the Holocaust, spreading unfounded claims about specific historical events could be used to distort understanding of these events, contributing indirectly to an environment where antisemitic narratives thrive.

4. **Intent and Impact**: Although intent is complex to ascertain directly from a tweet alone, the potential impact of sharing unverified information about sensitive topics such as the Holocaust can contribute to misinformation that aligns with or supports antisemitic narratives by undermining established historical facts.

Given these considerations, promoting an unverified claim about Jewish history during the Holocaust period without evidence could be seen as potentially harmful and misleading. This may indirectly support antisemitic narratives by fostering doubt about well-documented historical events, which is why this tweet can be classified as antisemitic under the JDA guidelines due to its lack of verification and potential for misinforming or spreading harm regarding Jewish history during the Holocaust.",0,1,0,1,0,0

1. **Content Analysis**: The tweet simply states that ""Congresswoman Omar keeps on assaulting Jews."" It does not provide details or examples of what constitutes these alleged assaults. Without further information, it's unclear whether this refers to physical acts, verbal statements, policy positions, or something else entirely. 

2. **IHRA Definition Context**: According to the IHRA definition:
   - Antisemitism involves specific perceptions and manifestations of hatred towards Jews.
   - It includes making dehumanizing or demonizing allegations against Jews as a collective group.
   - Criticism that parallels any other nation's treatment is not considered antisemitic unless it employs sinister stereotypes.

3. **Criticism vs. Antisemitism**: The tweet could be interpreted as criticism of Congresswoman Omar's actions or statements, which some might view as targeting Jewish people or Israel in a problematic manner. However, without explicit evidence of employing negative stereotypes, dehumanizing rhetoric, or false accusations about Jews as a collective group, it doesn't automatically qualify as antisemitic under the IHRA definition.

4. **Lack of Contextual Indicators**: The tweet does not include any derogatory language, accusations of conspiracy, denial of the Holocaust, or other explicit antisemitic tropes. It merely states that she is ""assaulting Jews,"" which could potentially refer to policy critiques rather than an antisemitic attack.

5. **Potential for Misinterpretation**: While some might interpret this as a veiled antisemitic accusation if they believe Congresswoman Omar's actions are unjustly targeting Jewish people, the tweet itself lacks explicit antisemitic content or context required by the IHRA definition to be classified definitively as such.

Here’s a breakdown of why this is considered antisemitic:

1. **Collective Responsibility**: By using the term ""assaulting Jews"" in connection with Congresswoman Omar's actions, the tweet implies that all Jews are being attacked or targeted because of their Jewish identity due to her alleged actions or statements. This aligns with guideline 7 from section B, which states that holding Jews collectively responsible for an individual’s conduct is antisemitic.

2. **Coded Language**: The statement can also be seen as coded language. It doesn’t specify any direct action by Congresswoman Omar against Jewish individuals but rather implies a broader assault on the entire Jewish community. This indirect approach fits within guideline 4, which notes that antisemitism can manifest in coded ways, often relying on context and judgment.

3. **Hostility**: The use of the term ""assaulting"" suggests hostility towards Jews as a group. According to the JDA definition, antisemitism includes hostility against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish), which is apparent here through the implication of repeated attacks.

4. **Condemnation and Pressure**: Although not explicitly stated in this tweet, if the context implies that Congresswoman Omar should be condemned or pressured due to her identity as a Jew, it could relate to guideline 8, which considers requiring Jews to publicly condemn Israel as antisemitic. This is more about pressure tactics based on group identity rather than individual actions.

Too much Islam!!!! Stop defamation of Jews!"" followed by a link. To determine if this is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we need to analyze its content and context:

1. **Perception and Expression**: The tweet does not express hatred toward Jews or dehumanize them. It instead calls for stopping the ""defamation of Jews,"" which aligns with opposing antisemitism.

2. **Manifestations Directed at Jews**: There is no indication that the tweet targets Jewish individuals, communities, or institutions in a harmful manner. Instead, it appears to be advocating against defamation towards Jews.

3. **Criticism vs. Antisemitism**: The phrase ""Too much Islam!!!!"" could potentially reflect criticism of Islam rather than antisemitic sentiment. Criticism of any religion or ideology is not inherently antisemitic unless it specifically targets Jewish people with hatred or dehumanizing rhetoric, which this tweet does not do.

4. **Context and Intent**: Without further context about the link or the user's intent beyond the text provided in the tweet, it’s difficult to fully assess any underlying messages. However, based solely on the text given, there is no clear antisemitic content as defined by IHRA.

In summary, while the phrasing might reflect a strong opinion regarding Islam, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the IHRA definition, which involves negative perceptions or actions specifically directed toward Jews.",Yes,"** The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) for several reasons:

1. **Implication of Jewish Conspiracy or Collective Power**: The phrase ""Too much Islam"" followed by ""Stop defamation of Jews"" could imply a collective power or influence associated with Jews, particularly in controlling narratives about other religions. This aligns with the JDA's guideline that antisemitism often involves ideas about Jews possessing hidden powers or conspiracies (guideline 2). While not explicitly mentioning Jewish control, the context may suggest an instrumentalization of ""the Jews"" as a group opposing Islam.

2. **Contextual Interpretation and Coded Speech**: The tweet lacks explicit content directly against Jews but can be seen as coded speech. It potentially links the defense or advocacy for Jews (against perceived defamation) with negative sentiments towards Islam, implying Jewish involvement in such actions. This fits into guideline 4, where antisemitism can manifest indirectly and requires contextual judgment.

3. **Instrumentalization of Antisemitic Narratives**: The tweet may be seen as using a general call to ""Stop defamation of Jews"" in the context of criticizing Islam, which could inadvertently perpetuate or capitalize on existing antisemitic narratives about Jewish power or influence over global affairs, especially in media and discourse.

4. **Potential for Hostility and Discrimination**: While not overtly hostile, such statements can contribute to an environment where hostility is implicit, aligning with the JDA's broad definition that includes prejudice and discrimination as forms of antisemitism.

It appears to address a situation involving individuals identified by their sexual orientation and religious or ethnic identity, but it does not contain any of the specific manifestations listed under the IHRA examples that define antisemitism. 

1. **Hate or Hostility**: There is no evident expression of hatred toward Jews. The tweet seems more focused on an action related to a person named ""Kirchik,"" without expressing animosity towards Jewish people as such.

2. **Dehumanizing or Demonizing Allegations**: The tweet does not include any dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews. It does not suggest that Jews have harmful intentions or conspiracy-like powers over society.

3. **Conspiracy Myths**: There is no mention of Jewish conspiracies controlling media, economy, government, or other societal institutions.

4. **Collective Blame for Wrongdoing**: The tweet does not accuse Jews as a group of any wrongdoing, nor does it blame them for the actions of an individual or another group.

5. **Holocaust Denial or Minimization**: There is no reference to denying or minimizing the Holocaust.

6. **Double Standards and Exaggeration**: The tweet does not apply double standards to Israel or Jews collectively, nor does it exaggerate any aspect related to Jewish people or the state of Israel.

7. **Use of Antisemitic Symbols/Imagery**: There is no usage of symbols or imagery associated with classic antisemitism, such as blood libel or claims about Jews killing Jesus.

8. **Comparisons to Nazis**: The tweet does not compare Israeli policies or actions to those of the Nazis.

9. **Collective Responsibility for State Actions**: It does not hold Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the state of Israel.

10. **Criminal Acts and Discrimination**: There is no suggestion that any criminal acts are being committed against Jewish individuals or properties, nor is there discrimination implied against Jews.

The language used in the tweet appears to be an attempt at humor or sarcasm without targeting Jews with hatred or stereotypes.

1. **Stereotyping**: By specifically mentioning ""hetero Jews,"" the tweet essentializes Jewish individuals based on their sexual orientation, implying a homogeneous identity among them. This can be seen as treating a character trait or group affiliation as inherent to all Jews, which is cautioned against in JDA's first guideline under Section A.

2. **Hostility**: The phrasing suggests an adversarial relationship between ""Jews"" and ""gay goyim,"" implying that they are separate groups with potentially conflicting interests. This kind of divisive language can foster hostility by pitting different communities against each other, even if indirectly or jokingly.

3. **Potential for Incitement**: Although the tweet is framed as a question about collective action (""combine forces""), it could be interpreted as inciting division or conflict between these groups. The underlying tone and context might contribute to social tensions, which aligns with the JDA's understanding of how antisemitism can manifest in words.

Overall, while the tweet may not explicitly express traditional antisemitic themes like conspiracy theories or Holocaust denial, it engages in stereotyping and uses divisive language that can be considered hostile towards Jews.

It questions whether there will be a similar response from Fox News regarding this issue. According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, criticism of Israeli government policy, when comparable to that leveled against any other country, is not considered antisemitic. 

In this tweet, there is no evidence suggesting it employs dehumanizing or demonizing rhetoric toward Jews as a collective group, nor does it make allegations about Jewish power or conspiracies. Instead, the content focuses on perceived hypocrisy in political discourse and media coverage related to U.S. politics, specifically mentioning Israel and American Jews' loyalty without attributing negative stereotypes or making unfounded claims against Jews.

The mention of ""double standards"" refers to a critique of inconsistency in addressing issues within political rhetoric rather than applying double standards to the State of Israel compared to other nations. Furthermore, there is no suggestion that Jewish people are being collectively blamed for actions attributed to Israeli policy or any other group behavior; instead, it points out an issue with perceived political and media reactions.

Thus, based on the context provided in the tweet and according to the IHRA definition, this does not constitute antisemitism. It remains a critique of political commentary rather than an expression of hatred toward Jews or Jewish institutions.",Yes,"The tweet in question highlights statements made by the president regarding American Jews and their alleged loyalty to Israel, suggesting a narrative of dual loyalty. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), specifically guideline 9, it is considered antisemitic to assume that non-Israeli Jews are necessarily more loyal to Israel than to their own countries simply because they are Jewish. This kind of assumption falls into the category of holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions or policies of Israel, which can stigmatize them as a group.

The mention in the tweet of ""amazing double standards"" when discussing this issue might be interpreted as criticism of those who do not express outrage over such statements. However, by focusing on the president's comments about loyalty, the tweet reflects an awareness of a potentially harmful stereotype or accusation being levied against American Jews. This aligns with the JDA's recognition that such narratives can contribute to antisemitic sentiment by implying Jewish people cannot be fully loyal citizens of their own countries.

Therefore, while the tweet itself is likely meant as criticism of the president's remarks rather than an endorsement, it discusses content that matches the JDA's definition of antisemitism. The context suggests it aims to highlight and criticize what can be seen as an antisemitic trope rather than propagate it. However, because it deals with a statement fitting the antisemitic definition described by the JDA, the assessment is ""Yes,"" recognizing the content that aligns with established antisemitic patterns.",0,1,0,1,0,0

It poses a cautionary statement regarding the assertion that ""Jews are a much more tightly knit ethnic group than other ethnicities,"" which could potentially touch on historical antisemitic tropes, but it does not itself express hatred toward Jews or employ stereotypes.

The tweet acknowledges the sensitive nature of discussing ethnic cohesion and appears to question whether such claims about Jewish communities are accurate or fair, comparing them with South Asian communities. It suggests caution in making broad generalizations that could inadvertently echo negative stereotypes. Importantly, there is no direct accusation against Jews as a people, nor does it imply any conspiracies, demonization, or dehumanization of Jewish individuals.

The tweet also lacks the context necessary to determine if any underlying antisemitic sentiment might be implied by its author. As such, based on the information provided and without additional context that could alter its interpretation, this statement alone does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the IHRA definition.",Yes,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is defined as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews specifically because they are Jewish. The tweet in question states, ""i'd encourage caution in saying things like 'Jews are a much more tightly knit ethnic group than other ethnicities' it walks line of historical antisemitic tropes."" This aligns with the JDA's emphasis on avoiding generalizations that can perpetuate stereotypes or prejudice.

The guidelines provided by the JDA indicate that making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews (or Jewish institutions) is considered racist and falls under the category of antisemitism. By highlighting that such statements ""walk the line of historical antisemitic tropes,"" the tweet acknowledges that suggesting Jews are more tightly knit than other ethnic groups could reinforce stereotypes that have been used historically to discriminate against or dehumanize Jews.

Moreover, the suggestion in the tweet calls for caution regarding this type of statement, recognizing its potential to echo harmful stereotypes. While the original tweet does not explicitly express antisemitic sentiment, it is addressing a concept that can be inherently problematic and linked to prejudice against Jews, thus aligning with the JDA's criteria for identifying potentially antisemitic discourse.

Overall, while the tweet itself may not demonstrate hostility or discrimination, its focus on avoiding a statement that could perpetuate an antisemitic trope means that it recognizes the potential for such statements to be harmful. Thus, within the context of the JDA guidelines, this recognition supports classifying concerns about similar statements as aligned with preventing antisemitism.",0,1,0,1,0,0

To assess whether a statement or action is antisemitic, several factors need consideration:

1. **Intent and Context**: The tweet mentions ""heroic Jews"" in connection with the Royal Air Force (RAF). This could be interpreted as positive recognition of Jewish contributions during World War II. Without additional context suggesting negative intent, such as demeaning stereotypes or harmful generalizations about Jews, this does not align with antisemitism.

2. **Content Analysis**: The IHRA definition highlights aspects like demonizing, dehumanizing, or stereotyping Jews, attributing conspiratorial or harmful characteristics to them collectively, denying the Holocaust, and holding Jews responsible for actions of others, among other criteria. This tweet does not appear to engage with any of these themes.

3. **Potential Misinterpretation**: While some might misinterpret the phrase ""hidden exploits"" as implying secrecy or ulterior motives in a negative sense, the overall framing of ""heroic"" suggests praise rather than criticism or conspiracy theory.

4. **Absence of Harmful Allegations**: The tweet does not accuse Jews of conspiring to harm humanity, nor does it dehumanize them or attribute negative character traits collectively. It doesn't deny historical events like the Holocaust or make comparisons between Israel and Nazi Germany.

Given these points, without further context indicating otherwise, this tweet lacks elements that would classify it as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. However, it is always important to consider the broader context in which such messages are disseminated to fully understand their implications.",Yes,"The tweet's reference to ""Hidden exploits of RAF’s heroic Jews"" can be analyzed using the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines. While the phrase itself does not directly align with any specific antisemitic sentiment described in the JDA, its context and potential implications should be carefully considered.

1. **Coded Language:** The use of ""hidden exploits"" might suggest a coded reference to conspiratorial ideas, which is a feature identified in guideline 2 of the JDA. This could imply an underlying message about Jews having secret or hidden power, aligning with antisemitic tropes that portray Jews as possessing influence behind the scenes.

2. **Contextual Analysis:** The context in which this phrase is used is crucial. If the tweet is part of a broader narrative that stereotypes Jews as conspiratorial or manipulative forces within society, it could be interpreted as an indirect manifestation of antisemitism under guideline 4.

3. **Implied Hostility or Prejudice:** While ""heroic"" seems positive on the surface, combined with ""hidden exploits,"" it may imply a kind of admiration for subversive actions, which can be interpreted as reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jewish secrecy and hidden agendas.

Given these points, while the tweet is not overtly antisemitic, its language and potential implications in context suggest an alignment with coded antisemitic ideas.

To determine if it aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, we must consider several aspects:

1. **Criticism vs. Antisemitism**: The tweet does not directly criticize Israel in a way that resembles typical antisemitic rhetoric (e.g., using stereotypes or conspiracies about Jewish control). Instead, it requests evidence for an unspecified claim and expresses concern over potentially slandering Jews.

2. **Condemnation of Potential Slurs**: By asking for the source of an argument or an apology to Jews, the tweet seems to express a concern about unfair treatment or defamation of Jews. This is contrary to engaging in antisemitic discourse, as it does not perpetuate negative stereotypes or hateful sentiments towards Jews.

3. **Lack of Specific Antisemitic Content**: The tweet lacks specific content that directly targets Jewish individuals or communities with derogatory, conspiratorial, or violent intent. It also avoids the use of classic antisemitic symbols or comparisons to Nazi actions.

4. **Contextual Consideration**: According to the IHRA definition, any criticism of Israel must be distinguished from antisemitism if it is similar in nature and substance to criticism leveled against any other country. The tweet does not provide sufficient context about the argument itself but implies an inquiry into whether such an argument unfairly targets Jews.

Overall, without more information on the content of the referenced argument, the tweet's intention appears to be questioning potential antisemitic implications rather than expressing them. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria outlined in the IHRA definition for antisemitism.",Yes,"** The tweet in question demands evidence or an apology concerning claims about Israel, referring to these claims as a ""slur"" on Jews. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), several guidelines are relevant here:

1. **Guideline 7**: It notes that holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct or treating them as agents of Israel is antisemitic. The tweet, by implying that criticisms of Israel equate to a slur on Jews in general, suggests collective responsibility.

2. **Guideline 8**: This guideline highlights the issue with requiring Jews to publicly condemn Israel or Zionism. While the tweet does not directly demand such a condemnation, it implies that criticism of Israel is inherently unjust and thus potentially places undue pressure on Jewish individuals to defend Israel as if their identity obligates them to do so.

3. **Guideline 2**: The idea that Jews are linked to negative forces, such as being responsible for or the targets of ""slurs"" due to criticisms of Israel, perpetuates a form of collective association with Israel's actions that is central to antisemitic stereotypes.

While the tweet does not explicitly use language from classical antisemitism (such as conspiracy theories about Jewish control), it implies that criticism of Israel inherently involves Jews in a negative way.

It suggests that being religious is viewed positively in Christians but negatively in Jews and Muslims, framing them as ""extremists"" or part of a ""brainwashed cult."" While this comment reflects an observation on perceived bias and discrimination based on religion, it does not explicitly align with the IHRA definition's examples of antisemitism.

The tweet doesn't target Jews specifically for hatred, nor does it make mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective. It doesn't attribute harmful stereotypes to Jews or suggest conspiracies involving Jewish people. Instead, it addresses perceived biases in the treatment of different religious groups generally and raises concerns about discrimination without making antisemitic claims.

Therefore, while the tweet touches on issues related to religious bias and could be seen as highlighting discriminatory perceptions, it does not fit within the IHRA definition's criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"** The tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines for several reasons:

1. **General Discrimination and Prejudice**: The tweet suggests a prejudiced view that Jews, when religious, are unfairly labeled as ""extremists"" or part of a ""brainwashed cult."" This reflects an essentializing bias—implying inherent negative characteristics among Jewish people based on their religious practices—which aligns with the JDA's definition of racism and antisemitism.

2. **Indirect Comparison**: By comparing how Christians are perceived versus Jews when practicing religion, the tweet indirectly touches upon stereotypes that associate Judaism with extremism or negative traits. This can perpetuate classic antisemitic stereotypes of Jews being different or dangerous due to their identity (as noted in guideline 2).

3. **Context and Implication**: Although the tweet does not directly attack Jewish people as a group, it implies an unjust bias against them by contrasting their treatment with that of Christians. This form of indirect prejudice can be considered antisemitic if it plays into existing stereotypes or suggests inherent negativity associated with Jewish identity.

We can read it.\nCHRISTIAN: It's lost forever,No,"The tweet in question involves an exchange between individuals identifying as Christians and Jews, discussing differing interpretations of a verse in the Old Testament. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism is characterized by certain perceptions of Jews expressed as hatred or negative stereotypes, often involving harmful actions, false accusations, or conspiracy theories directed at Jews.

In this tweet:
- The exchange reflects a disagreement over religious interpretation rather than an expression of hatred towards Jews.
- There are no allegations made against Jews or the Jewish people collectively that involve conspiracies, dehumanization, demonization, or stereotypical claims about their nature or actions.
- There is no evidence in the conversation of denial or distortion of historical events like the Holocaust, nor accusations related to loyalty or self-determination issues concerning Israel or the Jewish community.
- The interaction does not invoke classic antisemitic symbols or narratives.
- While the Christian party questions the certainty of Jewish understanding, this can be seen as a theological debate rather than an expression of antisemitism. It lacks the malicious intent and harmful stereotypes outlined in the IHRA definition.

Therefore, based on the content and context provided by the tweet, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the IHRA working definition. The exchange appears to be a religious discussion about scriptural interpretation rather than an act of discrimination or hatred towards Jews.",Yes,"** The tweet exhibits elements of indirect or coded antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It demonstrates several characteristics that align with the guidelines for recognizing antisemitic speech:

1. **Disregard for Jewish Authority and Knowledge**: By dismissing Jewish interpretation of their own texts (""We do know. That's not in the Hebrew""), the tweet subtly undermines Jewish authority over their religious texts. This could be seen as analogous to denying Jews' connection to or expertise about their heritage, which is a theme often found in antisemitic rhetoric.

2. **Tone and Context**: The tone of the interaction escalates from an initial disagreement into a dismissive argument, where the Christian commenter repeatedly invalidates Jewish claims of understanding their own scripture by asserting that ""no one knows what the original language means."" This can perpetuate a stereotype of Jewish people as deceitful or dishonest about their religious texts.

3. **Stereotyping and Hostility**: The dialogue includes elements of hostility and stereotyping. By implying that Jewish knowledge is not credible (""maybe. Who knows?""), it indirectly invokes stereotypes where Jewish claims are questioned, aligning with how antisemitism can manifest in questioning the validity or integrity of Jews' statements.

In summary, while the tweet doesn't explicitly employ classic antisemitic imagery or overt hostility against Jews as a people, its insinuation that Jewish interpretations and knowledge are not reliable plays into coded language and stereotypes. This qualifies it as antisemitic according to JDA's guidelines on indirect and coded forms of antisemitism.",0,1,0,1,0,0

1. **General Content**: The tweet seems to discuss differences among Jewish people and compares these to variations within Muslim groups, which does not in itself imply antisemitic sentiment.

2. **Religious Critique**: It mentions that the Quran is ""not as holy as you think,"" which appears to be a critique of religious beliefs rather than an attack on Jews or Judaism per se. This could be interpreted as a statement directed at followers of Islam, and not directly related to antisemitic ideology.

3. **Lack of Specific Allegations**: The tweet does not include any mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective group. It lacks elements such as accusations of conspiracy, control over societal institutions by Jews, or comparisons between Israelis and Nazis.

4. **Absence of Harmful Intent**: There is no indication within the tweet that it calls for harm against Jewish people, nor does it use classic antisemitic symbols or images to characterize Jews or Israelis.

5. **Contextual Limitations**: The broader context or links referenced in the tweet are not provided, so a comprehensive understanding is limited. However, based on the visible content, there is no clear evidence of antisemitism according to the IHRA definition.

1. **Essentializing and Generalization**: The tweet makes sweeping generalizations about Jews by implying there are many kinds, which can be seen as essentializing Jewish identity in a manner similar to the kind of generalization condemned under guideline A.1.

2. **Linking Jews with Evil**: While not explicit in this case, the encouragement to read ""the last sentence"" from an unspecified source could imply negative content about Jews or Judaism, potentially aligning with the idea that Jews are linked to evil forces if that is what the link entails. This follows guideline A.2.

3. **Manifestation in Words**: The tweet engages in discourse that can be interpreted as hostile towards Jews by undermining the sanctity of the Quran in comparison to Jewish beliefs or texts, which could foster hostility against Jews as a religious group. Such language can be considered antisemitic under guidelines A.3 and A.4.

4. **Coded Language**: Encouraging readers to view an external link without context may serve as coded speech if it contains antisemitic content, aligning with guideline A.4 regarding identifying coded or indirect expressions of antisemitism based on the context.

To determine whether this is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we need to evaluate if it fits any of the outlined examples or principles.

1. **Criticism vs. Antisemitism**: The tweet discusses historical political dynamics between communism and Zionism. Criticism of political ideologies like communism or actions taken by communist parties does not inherently constitute antisemitism unless it involves stereotypes or dehumanizing allegations against Jews as a group.

2. **Stereotypes and Conspiracy Allegations**: There is no mention in the tweet of using sinister stereotypes, demonizing imagery, or alleging conspiracies about Jewish people collectively controlling or manipulating world events.

3. **Blame for Wrongdoing**: The statement does not imply that Jewish people are responsible for any wrongdoing; it merely describes a historical relationship between political movements and ideologies.

4. **Historical Denial or Distortion**: There is no denial of the Holocaust, distortion of its facts, or accusation against Jews regarding their actions during World War II.

5. **Accusations about Loyalty or Self-determination**: The tweet does not discuss Jewish loyalty to Israel or other nations, nor does it deny the right of self-dimation to Jews.

6. **Double Standards or Comparisons with Nazis**: No double standards are being applied, nor is there any comparison made between Israeli policy and that of the Nazis.

In conclusion, while the tweet comments on historical political alignments, which may be controversial depending on one's perspective, it does not inherently meet the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It lacks elements such as stereotypes, dehumanizing language, or unfounded accusations against Jews as a people. Therefore, based solely on the information provided in the tweet and according to the IHRA definition, it is not considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet in question can be interpreted as antisemitic based on the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, particularly focusing on Guideline 2. This guideline emphasizes that a core aspect of classic antisemitism is the notion that Jews are linked to malevolent forces or conspiracies. By discussing ""Communism, Zionism, and the Jews"" together in a single narrative and implying they had a ""romance,"" the tweet suggests an inherent connection between Jewish identity and political movements (i.e., Communism and Zionism), which can be interpreted as reinforcing antisemitic stereotypes of Jews having hidden or collective agendas.

The phrasing implies that Jews were involved in conspiratorial politics by aligning with Communism, except for their support of Zionism. This could easily feed into the stereotype of Jewish control over global political movements—a notion commonly found in antisemitic rhetoric—as it suggests an overarching influence or conspiracy involving Jewish people without evidence and reduces complex historical and social dynamics to a simplistic narrative.

Moreover, while discussing historical relationships between Communist parties and Zionism, it does not provide context or analysis, potentially feeding into the idea of Jews as monolithic actors influencing global politics covertly. This lack of nuance can contribute to misunderstanding and perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, antisemitic behavior is specifically related to expressions or actions that manifest hatred toward Jews, often through stereotypical allegations, conspiracy theories, or other forms of discrimination targeting Jewish individuals or communities.

The tweet does not include any content that directly expresses hatred towards Jews. It mentions Jews as part of a collective group including Christians, Muslims, and Bodhis (Buddhists), suggesting an inclusive call to action against ""evils"" rather than singling out any one group for blame or harm. There are no allegations, stereotypes, conspiracies, or negative characterizations specific to Jews present in the message.

Additionally, none of the examples provided by the IHRA definition of antisemitism—such as accusations of global conspiracy, responsibility for wrongdoing, Holocaust denial, or the application of double standards—are evident in this tweet. The language used does not imply harm or discrimination against Jewish people specifically but rather suggests cooperation among different religious groups.

Thus, based on the content provided and considering the overall context outlined by the IHRA definition, the tweet is not antisemitic.",Yes,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet in question encourages various religious groups—Christians, Muslims, Jews, and Buddhists—to unite against ""evils,"" but it explicitly singles out Sikhs for their peaceful spirit while omitting a similar commendation for the Jewish community.

1. **Exclusion and Stereotyping:** By highlighting Sikhs as having the capacity to make the world peaceful without extending this acknowledgment or calling similarly for Jews, the tweet can imply that Jews lack this spiritual quality. This kind of omission can perpetuate negative stereotypes or suggest a deficiency in character traits associated with Jews, which aligns with guideline 1 about essentializing or generalizing negatively.

2. **Implied Hostility:** The phrasing ""lets be together to kill the evils"" suggests an adversarial stance towards certain unnamed 'evils.' While not directly naming Jews as such evils, it does create a context where any group could potentially fit this negative portrayal in an antagonistic or hostile environment. This indirectness is highlighted under guideline 4, which mentions that antisemitism can be direct or coded and often depends on the context.

3. **Potential Instrumentalization:** While the tweet doesn't explicitly connect Jews to evil forces like those described in guideline 2 (e.g., conspiracies), its exclusionary tone and call for unity among other religious groups against a vague notion of ""evils"" could be interpreted as setting up an implicit contrast or exclusion, which can be exploited instrumentally by antisemitic narratives.

4. **Double Standards and Comparisons**: There is no application of double standards towards Israel beyond questioning certain actions, which falls under legitimate criticism when similar standards are applied universally, as per the IHRA definition's clarification that not all criticism of Israel constitutes antisemitism.

5. **Call for Harm or Violence**: The tweet does not advocate for violence or harm against Jews but instead discusses legal or journalistic accountability in cases involving Jewish individuals or communities.

In summary, while the tweet may be critical and questions certain actions related to terrorism and media reporting, it lacks elements that align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It does not involve hate speech, conspiracy theories, historical distortion, or calls for harm against Jews as a group or individually. Therefore, according to the provided definition, this tweet is not antisemitic.",Yes,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is defined as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). The tweet in question raises concerns under several of the guidelines provided by JDA:

1. **Guideline 7**: This guideline states that holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct or treating Jews simply because they are Jewish as agents of Israel is antisemitic. By questioning why a person promotes content that allegedly overlooks the lynchings of Jews and criticizing their stance on terrorists who attack Jews, the tweet implies a collective responsibility or bias among Jews related to political matters concerning Israel.

2. **Guideline 8**: This guideline involves requiring people because they are Jewish to publicly condemn Israel or Zionism at political meetings. The implication in the tweet that the individual should explain why they promote content ignoring specific historical events affecting Jews can be seen as a similar kind of pressure on an individual based on their perceived association with Jewish identity.

The tweet appears to suggest that because the person is Jewish, they should act against what is implied to be a biased narrative. This falls into the realm of indirect antisemitism by implying collective accountability and exerting pressure based on religious or ethnic identity rather than addressing the content or actions individually.

Thus, the tweet can be considered antisemitic as it aligns with several aspects defined under JDA's guidelines for recognizing discrimination against Jews based on their identity.",0,1,0,1,0,0

It instead makes derogatory remarks about Muslims, referring to them as ""infidels,"" which is a term sometimes used in religious contexts to describe someone who does not follow the Islamic faith. The tweet also compares non-Muslims favorably to Jews and pigs in a specific context of how rape is perceived within their religion.

While the language used is offensive and demonstrates bigotry, particularly against Muslims, it does not align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism as there are no direct accusations or stereotypes about Jews, nor any mentions of Jewish conspiracy theories, control, or collective blame. The tweet also lacks elements such as denying the Holocaust, attributing negative actions to the entirety of a Jewish group, or criticizing the state of Israel in an antisemitic manner.

The IHRA definition is specific to antisemitism and does not cover other forms of hate speech unless they intersect with antisemitic tropes or conspiracy theories. While it's important to address all forms of discrimination and bigotry, this particular tweet does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic according to the provided IHRA working definition. However, it is important to note that expressing hateful views against any group can still be harmful and may be subject to legal or social consequences depending on jurisdiction and platform policies.",Yes,"The tweet in question contains language that can be classified as antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines. Specifically, it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and associations involving Jews by stating that ""anyone who is an infidel is below Jews."" This positions Jews within a hierarchy of religious or moral status, implying inherent qualities about Jews in relation to other groups. Such essentialization aligns with the JDA's assertion that treating a character trait as inherent (i.e., racism and antisemitism) is problematic.

Additionally, the tweet uses language that dehumanizes certain groups (""rape isnt classed as rape if they are non Muslim"") and includes derogatory terms such as ""infidel,"" ""pigs,"" and ""bastards."" These elements reflect prejudice and hostility towards specific religious or ethnic communities. The statement also indirectly associates Jews with negative attributes by suggesting their status is higher than others, even in a context framed negatively.

Furthermore, the tweet employs coded language that might be interpreted as antisemitic depending on its context and intent. By placing Jews above ""pigs"" (a derogatory term for non-believers or Muslims), it potentially links to classical antisemitic imagery of Jews possessing hidden power or moral superiority used against others, aligning with guideline 2 from the JDA.

In summary, the tweet meets several criteria outlined in the JDA for antisemitism, particularly through its use of coded language that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes about Jews and their association with evil or negative qualities.",0,1,0,1,0,0

The text of the tweet is a question that expresses curiosity or confusion about why a particular topic related to Jewish people was trending on social media. It lacks any explicit hateful rhetoric, negative stereotyping, or incitement to harm directed at Jews as individuals or as a collective.

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves expressions of hatred toward Jews or manifestations that involve dehumanizing, demonizing, or making stereotypical allegations about Jews. The tweet does not contain any such elements; it neither accuses Jews of conspiracies nor attributes negative characteristics or actions to them collectively. It also does not deny the Holocaust, question Israel's right to self-determination, or apply double standards to Israel.

However, context is crucial in determining whether similar expressions might be antisemitic. If additional context surrounding the tweet suggests that it was part of a larger pattern of harassment or targeted at inciting negative sentiment against Jews, then further evaluation would be necessary. In isolation, as provided, the tweet simply poses an inquiry and does not constitute an antisemitic statement according to the IHRA definition.",Yes,"** 

The tweet ""Why were Jews trending at like 6am"" can be interpreted as potentially antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) for several reasons:

1. **Implication of Conspiracy or Hidden Power**: The phrase suggests that there might be a reason for Jews being discussed, particularly during an unusual time like 6 am, which could imply hidden activities or influence. This aligns with guideline 2 in the JDA, where antisemitism often involves attributing to Jews undue power and conspiratorial actions (""the Jews"" possessing hidden power).

2. **Contextual Interpretation**: The tweet lacks context but raises suspicion because it implicitly questions why a Jewish topic was trending at an unusual hour. Without additional information, this can easily be seen as implying nefarious reasons or secretive influence, which falls under the coded forms of antisemitism described in guideline 4.

3. **Potential for Hostility or Prejudice**: While not explicit, questioning why ""Jews"" were trending could convey a sense of scrutiny or suspicion directed specifically at Jewish individuals or topics. This could foster an atmosphere of hostility or prejudice based on stereotypes about Jewish influence and activity, which aligns with the definition provided in the JDA.

4. **Lack of Specific Evidence**: The tweet does not provide any specific evidence or legitimate reasoning for why Jews were trending, making it seem more like an unfounded inquiry that could perpetuate negative stereotypes or unwarranted suspicion towards Jewish people.

In summary, while the tweet is ambiguous and lacks explicit antisemitic language, its implications can be interpreted as fitting certain patterns of antisemitism as outlined in the JDA, particularly relating to conspiracy theories and coded references to Jewish power. Therefore, according to these guidelines, it would be considered potentially antisemitic.",0,1,0,1,0,0

On its face, it appears to be providing historical information relevant to Holocaust remembrance and does not contain any overtly antisemitic content based on the IHRA definition.

To determine if this tweet could be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we must consider several factors:

1. **Expression of Hatred**: The tweet does not express hatred toward Jews or manifest in speech or action that employs sinister stereotypes or negative character traits about Jews.

2. **Accusations and Conspiracies**: There is no mention or implication of a Jewish conspiracy or collective blame for any wrongdoing, nor are there dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations made against Jews as such.

3. **Holocaust Denial/Minimization**: The tweet does not deny the Holocaust, its scope, mechanisms, or intentionality. It references historical events from the 1930s without making false claims about the Holocaust itself.

4. **Attacking Israel or Jewish Self-Determination**: There is no mention of Israel, nor is there any denial of the right to self-determination for the Jewish people or criticism that could be construed as applying double standards uniquely to Israel compared to other countries.

5. **Criminal Acts or Discrimination**: The tweet does not describe or incite criminal acts against Jews or discrimination toward them.

Without additional context suggesting malicious intent, such as accompanying material or commentary that frames this fact in a harmful way, the content of the tweet itself aligns with providing educational information relevant to Holocaust remembrance rather than engaging in antisemitic expression. Therefore, according to the provided IHRA definition, it is not considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet in question references Holocaust Remembrance Day and mentions tactics used to keep European Jews out of the United States in the 1930s, which can be interpreted as a coded or indirect statement that might fall under antisemitic guidelines outlined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

1. **Coded Language**: According to guideline 4 of the JDA, antisemitism can manifest through coded language. The tweet hints at historical discrimination against Jews without providing explicit context. The reference to tactics used against European Jews in the 1930s could imply a contemporary parallel or conspiracy theory about Jewish influence, which aligns with classic antisemitic narratives that suggest Jews are responsible for their own persecution.

2. **Historical Context**: The mention of preventing European Jews from entering the United States during the 1930s evokes historical antisemitism and can be seen as minimizing the specific suffering experienced by Jews under Nazi policies, which could relate to guideline 5 regarding Holocaust denial or minimization. By implying that similar tactics are still relevant today without further context, it risks undermining the unique gravity of Jewish persecution in history.

3. **Lack of Context**: The tweet lacks additional context to clarify its intent. Without further explanation, such a statement can be interpreted as suggesting ongoing conspiratorial actions against Jews or diminishing their historical suffering by equating past and present circumstances without nuance.

In summary, the tweet appears to utilize coded language that aligns with classic antisemitic themes and risks minimizing Holocaust experiences, thus fitting within the JDA's definition of antisemitism.",0,1,0,1,0,0

Let's analyze why:

1. **Reference to History**: The tweet references a period when Jews experienced mass arrests during the Holocaust (1941-1945), which is historically accurate and acknowledges a significant tragedy that affected Jewish people. This itself is neither antisemitic nor denies historical facts.

2. **Criticism of Political Allegiances**: It suggests questioning Di Blasio's political leanings (""How invested with China are you? NewGreat Leap Forward"") rather than targeting Jews or Judaism as a whole. The mention of being ""Communist Socialist"" does not directly relate to Jewish people but criticizes perceived political ideologies.

3. **Lack of Stereotyping or Demonization**: There is no expression in the tweet that utilizes dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews collectively. It doesn't accuse Jews as a group of conspiring against humanity or attribute negative traits specifically to them.

4. **No Conspiracy Theories or Blame**: The tweet does not perpetuate myths such as a world Jewish conspiracy or imply that Jews control societal institutions.

5. **Absence of Holocaust Denial or Distortion**: There is no denial, minimization, or distortion of the Holocaust's facts in this message.

6. **No Double Standards Related to Israel**: The tweet does not apply double standards to Israel compared to other nations nor uses symbols associated with classic antisemitism to characterize Israelis.

In conclusion, while the language used might be seen as harsh or politically charged, it does not constitute antisemitism under the IHRA definition because it lacks elements such as hate speech towards Jews, conspiracy myths, denial of the Holocaust, or demonization of Jewish people collectively. It appears more focused on political criticism than promoting hatred against Jews.",Yes,"The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) for several reasons:

1. **Historical Minimization and Denial**: The reference to Jews having ""gone through mass arrests once before 1941 - 1945 during the Holocaust or Ha-Shoah"" implies a minimization of the Holocaust's significance. While it does not outright deny the Holocaust, it trivializes its impact by equating it with other historical events involving Jewish persecution. This aligns with guideline 5 under section A, which states that denying or minimizing the Holocaust is antisemitic.

2. **Conflation and Insinuation**: The tweet accuses Di Blasio of being ""Communist Socialist"" and questions his political investments, particularly with China, using terms like ""NewGreat Leap Forward."" This language may imply a coded message by invoking historical anti-Jewish tropes related to conspiracy theories about Jewish influence on global finance and politics (see guideline 2 under section A). Such insinuations can indirectly propagate antisemitic stereotypes.

3. **Emotional Tone and Hostility**: The phrase ""Whisky Tango Foxtrot is wrong with you"" conveys hostility and a dismissive attitude towards the person being addressed, suggesting an underlying prejudice. This kind of hostile expression aligns with the definition in the JDA that encompasses hostility or violence against Jews as Jews.

Overall, while the tweet may not explicitly express classical antisemitic tropes, it contains elements that can be interpreted as minimizing Jewish suffering during the Holocaust and using coded language to suggest conspiratorial control by Jews, both of which are identified within the JDA guidelines as forms of antisemitism.",0,1,0,1,0,0

1. **Perception of Jews**: The tweet does not express a perception of Jews that involves hatred or hostility. It comments on racial categorization rather than attributing negative qualities or actions to Jewish people.

2. **Manifestations Directly Against Jews**: The tweet lacks any direct rhetoric or action against Jewish individuals, their properties, community institutions, or religious facilities. It is more an observation about societal perceptions of race and ethnicity.

3. **Conspiracies or Demonizing Allegations**: There are no allegations that dehumanize, demonize, or stereotype Jews as a group, nor does it suggest any conspiracy involving Jewish people. The tweet does not attribute negative power or control to Jews collectively.

4. **Blame for Wrongdoing**: It does not accuse Jews of being responsible for any real or imagined wrongdoing. There is no implication that Jews are held accountable for actions they have not committed.

5. **Holocaust Denial or Distortion**: The tweet makes no reference to the Holocaust, its denial, exaggeration, or distortion.

6. **Loyalty and Double Standards**: It does not question Jewish loyalty to their countries of residence nor apply double standards specifically to Jews or Israel.

7. **Use of Antisemitic Symbols or Comparisons**: There are no symbols, images, or comparisons associated with classic antisemitism in the tweet.

8. **Collective Responsibility for Israel**: The tweet does not hold Jews collectively responsible for actions taken by the state of Israel.

9. **Criminal Acts or Discrimination**: It neither suggests a criminal act against Jews nor denies them opportunities or services based on their identity.

The tweet appears to be making a sociological observation about racial categorization and does not meet any criteria outlined in the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic according to that framework.",Yes,"The tweet in question can be interpreted as antisemitic according to the guidelines of the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Here’s why:

1. **Essentialization and Generalizations**: The tweet makes a sweeping statement about Jews by implying they change racial identification (""white"") based on convenience or personal gain, which aligns with guideline 1 of section A in JDA. This kind of generalization is inherently negative and essentializes Jewish identity.

2. **Linkage to Evil Forces**: Although not explicit here, such statements can subtly evoke the notion that Jews have hidden motives or power, resonating with the classic antisemitic idea from guideline 2 where Jews are linked to manipulative forces for self-benefit.

3. **Instrumentalization and Coded Speech**: The tweet uses a coded form of speech (""Funny how Mexicans and Jews are white when it suits"") that might not be directly antisemitic but can carry underlying negative stereotypes or imply deceitfulness in the Jewish community. This fits with guideline 4, which discusses how antisemitism can manifest indirectly through context-dependent language.

By these interpretations under JDA's framework, the tweet can contribute to a harmful narrative about Jewish identity and motivations, thus qualifying as antisemitic despite its indirect approach.",0,1,0,1,0,0

These groups are associated with antisemitic beliefs and actions, including chants like ""Jews will not replace us,"" which is a clear manifestation of antisemitism as defined by the IHRA.

However, the tweet itself does not express these antisemitic sentiments directly. Instead, it poses a question regarding whether President Trump's rally was labeled as ""Unite the Right"" or ""Unite the Left."" The intent behind this framing appears to be a challenge to perceived inconsistencies in labeling rallies and their affiliations rather than an endorsement of the ideologies expressed at such events.

The tweet does not engage in any of the specific antisemitic behaviors listed by the IHRA definition, such as making dehumanizing or demonizing allegations about Jews, denying the Holocaust, comparing Israel’s policies to those of Nazis in a harmful context, or blaming Jews for societal problems. It neither supports nor dismisses the antisemitic actions that occurred at the rally but rather focuses on political framing and labeling.

Given this analysis, while the tweet references an event known for antisemitic acts, it does not itself contain antisemitic content according to the IHRA definition. Thus, under the information provided in the tweet, it is not classified as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet references the chant ""Jews will not replace us,"" which is associated with antisemitic ideology and was infamously used during a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. This phrase has been widely recognized as an expression of antisemitism because it implies that Jews are a threat to the perceived purity or identity of a particular group, echoing classic anti-Jewish stereotypes about Jewish conspiracy theories.

According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, one key aspect of antisemitism is treating Jews as linked with evil forces or conspiratorial actions against others. The phrase ""Jews will not replace us"" suggests that Jews are seen as part of an external force attempting to displace or undermine the cultural and demographic status quo, which aligns closely with historical antisemitic tropes described in guideline 2.

Furthermore, the tweet associates this chant with a rally supporting President Trump, implying potential endorsement or indirect support for such views. While it does not explicitly promote antisemitism, by drawing attention to an event where explicit antisemitic rhetoric was used and questioning its characterization (""Unite the Right"" vs. ""Unite the Left""), the tweet engages in dialogue about this incident in a manner that might perpetuate divisive or hostile narratives concerning Jews.

Therefore, although the primary intent of the tweet is to question historical narratives rather than directly promote hate, it does reference an explicitly antisemitic slogan. According to JDA guidelines, which recognize both direct and indirect manifestations of antisemitism, referencing such slogans in a public forum without clear condemnation can be considered as indirectly engaging with or normalizing antisemitic sentiments.",0,1,0,1,0,0

This antisemite is NOT our ally.,No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we need to analyze its content against the provided examples and criteria.

1. **Language and Context**: The tweet mentions Cori Bush and Linda Sarsour, suggesting disagreement over who their allies should be but does not express hatred toward Jews as a group or use dehumanizing language about them.

2. **Criticism vs. Antisemitism**: Criticizing individuals or political stances is not inherently antisemitic unless it incorporates hateful stereotypes or accusations against Jewish people as a collective. The tweet criticizes the individuals' stance, labeling one as an ""antisemite,"" but does not include broader, harmful generalizations about Jews.

3. **Lack of Allegations and Stereotypes**: The tweet does not make mendacious, dehumanizing, or demonizing allegations about Jews. It focuses on political disagreement regarding alliances without invoking negative stereotypes associated with antisemitism in the IHRA definition.

4. **Denial or Double Standards**: There is no indication that the tweet denies Jewish self-determination, applies double standards to Israel, or compares Israeli policies to those of the Nazis, which are listed as examples of antisemitic acts by the IHRA.

5. **Perceived Targeting**: While the term ""antisemite"" could be contentious depending on context, its use in this tweet is directed at specific individuals (not Jews in general) and relates to a disagreement over political alliances rather than an attack on Jewish people or communities.

In conclusion, based on the content of the tweet and the IHRA definition of antisemitism, there is insufficient evidence that it constitutes antisemitic behavior. It expresses a political stance without engaging in the harmful rhetoric outlined by the IHRA examples.",Yes,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. In this tweet, the use of the term ""antisemite"" in reference to ""@lsarsour,"" combined with a directive not to tell Jews who their allies are, implies collective responsibility and a questioning of loyalty among Jews.

1. **Guideline 7:** This guideline states that holding Jews collectively responsible for another individual's conduct is considered antisemitic. By implying that all Jews should heed the opinion of one person (@lsarsour) regarding their alliances, the tweet indirectly suggests that Jewish individuals cannot be trusted to make independent judgments about political allies.

2. **Guideline 9:** This involves assuming that non-Israeli Jews are more loyal to Israel than to their own countries. Although this specific guideline does not perfectly align with the content of the tweet, it underscores a broader theme within antisemitic discourse: questioning Jewish loyalty and agency based on collective identity rather than individual choice.

The tweet contributes to an environment where Jewish people might be seen as acting uniformly according to certain stereotypes or expectations imposed by others. This is indicative of prejudice against Jews as a group, which aligns with the definition of antisemitism under JDA guidelines. Therefore, the tweet can be considered antisemitic based on these interpretations and contexts provided by the declaration.",0,1,0,1,0,0

Instead, it presents a dialogue between two parties: one labeling Farrakhan as anti-Semitic due to his perceived hatred towards Jews, and another providing a link (likely referencing content that might provide more context on Farrakhan's views). 

To determine if this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, several factors need further consideration:

1. **Content of the Link**: The actual content at the provided URL could be crucial in determining whether it includes any antisemitic rhetoric or actions as defined by IHRA (such as demonization, stereotypes, Holocaust denial, etc.).

2. **Intent and Context**: Understanding the intent behind the tweet—whether it aims to highlight a legitimate critique of Farrakhan based on specific evidence or if it uses his statements in a manner that propagates harmful stereotypes about Jews—is essential.

3. **Farrakhan's Known Statements**: Louis Farrakhan has been publicly associated with making antisemitic remarks, such as perpetuating conspiracy theories and using demonizing language against Jews. If the tweet highlights these aspects without further harmful context or intent, it might be more of a factual statement rather than an act of spreading antisemitism.

4. **Audience Perception**: While not directly outlined in the IHRA definition, how this message is perceived by its audience—whether it incites hatred or discrimination against Jews—can also influence whether the tweet could be considered part of a broader antisemitic discourse.

Without additional context from the link and understanding the intent behind the tweet, it's challenging to definitively classify it as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. It highlights an accusation that Farrakhan is anti-Semitic but does not by itself engage in antisemitic conduct or rhetoric.",Yes,"** 

To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze both the content of the tweet and the context provided by the JDA guidelines.

1. **Content Analysis:**
   - The tweet includes a claim that Farrakhan is an anti-Semite, implying he holds prejudicial views against Jews. 
   - The response from Farrakhan does not address this accusation directly but rather provides a link (not available in the text), potentially to justify or explain his position.

2. **Contextual Analysis Using JDA Guidelines:**
   - **Guideline 1:** Essentializing or making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews is considered racist and antisemitic.
   - **Guideline 2:** Central to antisemitism is the idea of Jewish conspiracies and collective blame, often manifesting as hostile attitudes toward Jewish identity itself. If Farrakhan's statements (or those implied by his link) reinforce such stereotypes or portray Jews negatively, this would align with classical antisemitic tropes.
   - **Guideline 3:** Antisemitism can be manifested in words, images, and deeds. The tweet implies negative characterizations of Jews through the label ""anti-Semite.""
   - **Guideline 4:** Indirect or coded language that perpetuates antisemitic ideas is also considered antisemitic. If Farrakhan's linked content uses such language to indirectly express hostility towards Jews, it would be relevant here.

Given that Louis Farrakhan has a documented history of making statements that align with antisemitic tropes (such as suggesting Jewish influence over media or finance), and assuming the link supports these narratives, this tweet can be seen as reinforcing harmful stereotypes about Jews. Therefore, according to the JDA's guidelines on what constitutes antisemitism, especially under guidelines 2 and 3 regarding prejudice, hostility, and the perpetuation of negative generalizations, the tweet is deemed antisemitic.

It's important to emphasize that without direct access to the linked content, this analysis relies on known contexts associated with Farrakhan’s public statements. However, based on these elements and past behaviors, the decision aligns with the JDA criteria for antisemitism.",0,1,0,1,0,0

1. **Conflation of Jews and the State of Israel**: The IHRA definition acknowledges that antisemitism may include the conflation of criticism of Israel with Jews as a whole. However, it also specifies that legitimate criticism of Israel, similar to any other country, is not inherently antisemitic. In this tweet, Keir Starmer's action is criticized for conflating Jews and the State of Israel. The assertion here implies political or procedural critique rather than an expression of hatred toward Jewish people.

2. **Expression of Hatred**: The IHRA definition characterizes antisemitism as a certain perception of Jews expressed as hatred. This tweet does not express hatred towards Jews; instead, it critiques a perceived political action by Keir Starmer related to Labour Party dynamics.

3. **Use of Antisemitic Allegations or Stereotypes**: The tweet does not employ stereotypes, demonizing allegations, or myths about Jewish people or their alleged collective power. It focuses on a specific event involving Labour Party leadership and internal decisions regarding political figures.

4. **Criminal Acts**: There is no indication that the tweet involves criminal acts against Jews or property linked to them, nor does it advocate for such actions.

5. **Call for Resignation Based on Alleged Antisemitism**: The call for Keir Starmer's resignation due to perceived antisemitic behavior addresses concerns about political conduct rather than promoting antisemitic views or actions.

In summary, while the tweet criticizes a specific action by a political leader and suggests it constitutes antisemitism according to Labour Party standards (not IHRA), it does not meet the IHRA criteria for expressing hatred towards Jews as individuals or as a collective. Therefore, based on the IHRA definition alone, this tweet is not antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet asserts that Keir Starmer's action of conflating Jews with the State of Israel constitutes antisemitism, specifically referencing ""classic, knee-jerk antisemitism."" According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), one form of antisemitism involves applying negative stereotypes or symbols associated with classical antisemitism to the State of Israel. This is outlined in guideline 6. The tweet also suggests that treating Jews as agents of Israel, a concept mentioned in guideline 7, is another manifestation of this kind of antisemitism.

By making these claims, the tweet argues that Starmer’s actions fall within the boundaries of antisemitic behavior as defined by JDA guidelines concerning Israel and Palestine. The accusation implies that there is an unjust collective responsibility being placed on Jews regarding the conduct of the Israeli state, which the JDA recognizes as potentially antisemitic when done indiscriminately.

Additionally, the tweet's call for Starmer to resign due to this alleged behavior underscores its stance that such actions are not only inappropriate but also meet the criteria for antisemitism under the guidelines referenced. Therefore, based on these arguments and the definitions provided by the JDA, the tweet can be interpreted as identifying antisemitic elements in the described scenario.",0,1,0,1,0,0

To assess if this is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we need to analyze its content against the outlined criteria.

1. **Calling for harm or violence**: The tweet does not call for or justify any harm or violence towards Jews. It simply poses questions regarding equality and freedom of religion.

2. **Dehumanizing or demonizing allegations**: There are no dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews in the tweet. It appears to be questioning specific aspects of social and political equality without employing negative stereotypes or character traits.

3. **Collective blame or conspiracy**: The tweet does not accuse Jews as a people of any wrongdoing or suggest they have undue control over societal institutions. It addresses a specific governmental context (Israel) and does not imply a broader Jewish conspiracy or collective responsibility for actions attributed to the state of Israel.

4. **Holocaust denial or minimization**: There is no mention or implication regarding the Holocaust, so this aspect of antisemitism does not apply here.

5. **Denial of self-determination**: While the tweet questions aspects of political representation and religious freedom, it does not deny the Jewish people's right to self-determination or claim that Israel’s existence is inherently racist.

6. **Double standards**: The questions posed might imply concerns about double standards in terms of political equality within Israel (such as leadership roles), but this alone does not constitute antisemitism under the IHRA definition without additional context indicating a broader prejudice against Jews.

7. **Use of classic antisemitic symbols or comparisons to Nazis**: There are no references to classic antisemitic tropes or comparisons between Israeli policy and Nazi actions.

8. **Collective responsibility for state actions**: The tweet questions political dynamics within Israel but does not hold Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the Israeli government, which would be a form of antisemitism according to the IHRA definition.

Overall, while the tweet raises critical questions about equality and freedom in specific contexts, it lacks elements that align with the antisemitic manifestations outlined by the IHRA. The questions appear more related to political critique rather than targeting Jews as a group or employing antisemitic stereotypes or conspiracy theories. Therefore, based on the available content, this tweet does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet in question raises several points that align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, particularly under guidelines related to Israel and Palestine. Here is a breakdown of why this tweet can be considered antisemitic:

1. **Collective Responsibility**: By questioning whether Arabs ""as equal as they are to each other"" could be leaders in the Knesset (Israeli parliament) or have access to certain data, the tweet implies that Jews collectively hold power and privilege over non-Jews within Israel. This aligns with guideline 7 of the JDA, which states that holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions or policies of Israel is antisemitic.

2. **Linking Jews with Power**: The tweet suggests a scenario where Jewish people are in control (""access to all those data"") and implies questioning this power structure by comparing it unfavorably with Arab treatment within Israel. This taps into guideline 2, which highlights that antisemitism involves attributing negative qualities or undue influence (like hidden agendas or controlling powers) specifically to Jews.

3. **Comparison with Muslim Countries**: The question about Jewish freedom to pray in Muslim-majority countries touches on stereotypes and could be interpreted as questioning the safety or rights of Jews based on their identity, which might indirectly reinforce harmful stereotypes about Jews being persecuted or not having equal status everywhere—a narrative that has historically been exploited in antisemitic contexts.

Overall, while some elements of the tweet can be seen as political questions regarding Israeli policies, they also resonate with antisemitic themes by suggesting collective Jewish control and responsibility, aligning with JDA's definition.",0,1,0,1,0,0

To determine if this is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we must analyze it based on the examples and characteristics outlined.

1. **Perception of Jews**: The tweet mentions ""caring so little about Jews,"" which could be seen as a negative stereotype or perception; however, context is crucial in determining whether it constitutes antisemitism. 

2. **Expressions of Hatred or Harm**: There's no explicit expression of hatred toward Jews, nor any call for harm or violence against Jewish individuals or communities.

3. **Conflation with Israel or State Actions**: The tweet does not make claims about the state of Israel or attribute actions to all Jews as a group, which are common themes in antisemitic rhetoric according to the IHRA examples.

4. **Demonization or Dehumanization**: The statement lacks mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations specifically targeting Jews.

5. **Historical Denial or Distortion**: There is no denial or distortion of historical events like the Holocaust mentioned in the tweet.

6. **Collective Responsibility or Conspiracy**: It does not accuse Jews collectively for any actions or imply a conspiracy involving Jewish control over societal institutions.

7. **Double Standards or Comparisons to Nazis**: The tweet does not apply double standards specifically to Israel, nor does it draw comparisons of Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.

8. **Criminal Acts and Discrimination**: There is no indication of criminal acts against Jews or discriminatory actions described in the tweet.

In summary, while the tweet may express a negative sentiment regarding perceptions of Jewish care, it does not meet several key criteria outlined by the IHRA definition for antisemitism, such as explicit hatred, harmful intent, conspiracy theories, or historical denial. The context suggests a critique of using opposition to police violence as an excuse against a political opponent rather than an attack on Jews or Judaism itself. Therefore, according to the IHRA's working definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet suggests that opposition to global police violence is equated with antisemitism, implying that those who criticize such violence are being labeled as haters of Jews. This kind of assertion can be linked to Guideline 4 in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), which notes that antisemitism can manifest in coded or indirect ways.

The tweet implies a scenario where opposition to police brutality is used unjustifiably against someone, potentially framing them as anti-Jewish. This aligns with the idea of using ""antisemitic"" claims instrumentally for political purposes, such as discrediting an opponent (as per Guideline 2). It creates an analogy between unrelated issues (global police violence and antisemitism) that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes about Jews.

Furthermore, by suggesting that equating these two is a ""casual"" or dismissive act, the tweet may indirectly reinforce negative stereotypes or associations with Jewish communities. This aligns with how coded language can contribute to antisemitic discourse by implying an inherent link between unrelated issues and Jewish people, which can stigmatize Jews as part of broader political maneuvers.

Therefore, while not explicitly using antisemitic language or symbols, the tweet can be seen as engaging in a form of indirect or coded antisemitism according to the JDA definition.",0,1,0,1,0,0

More than half of the 66 million who receive earned income through Social Security will die because of him.",No,"The tweet in question does not meet the criteria set out by the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It draws a parallel between former President Trump and Adolf Hitler based on alleged potential policy actions concerning Social Security and Medicare, which are domestic issues related to U.S. government programs affecting Americans broadly, rather than targeting Jews or Jewish institutions specifically.

The tweet does not include any rhetoric that expresses hatred toward Jews, nor does it manifest as rhetorical or physical violence directed at Jewish individuals, their property, or community institutions. There is no reference to Jews conspiring to harm humanity, nor are there any allegations attributing actions against society to Jews or the state of Israel. The comparison made in the tweet centers around a political critique rather than employing antisemitic stereotypes or conspiracy theories commonly associated with anti-Jewish sentiment.

While the comparison to Hitler can be inflammatory and is likely intended as an extreme criticism, it does not fit within the IHRA examples that describe actions or rhetoric specifically targeting Jews because of their Jewish identity. Instead, this example falls more into a broader category of political hyperbole rather than antisemitism according to the provided definition.

It's important to note, however, that while the tweet is not antisemitic under this specific definition, it might still be considered offensive or provocative by some, and can contribute to harmful discourse. The IHRA definition focuses on anti-Jewish sentiment and actions, which is distinct from other types of political criticism or controversial statements.",Yes,"The tweet in question is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition and guidelines for several reasons:

1. **Code and Implication**: The mention of ""Agolf Twitler"" appears to be a coded reference, potentially linking President Trump with Adolf Hitler by using altered names (""Golf"" as a play on ""A-Gulf,"" possibly implying ""Adolf""). This kind of coding is often used to evoke antisemitic themes.

2. **Historical Context and Stereotypes**: By comparing Trump's policies to those of Hitler, the tweet implies a direct connection between Jewish people and evil forces—echoing one of the core ideas in classic antisemitism mentioned in guideline 2. This linkage is historically rooted in anti-Jewish propaganda, which has often portrayed Jews as having disproportionate control or malevolence.

3. **Holocaust Minimization**: The statement compares Trump's potential impact on Social Security and Medicare to Hitler's genocide against six million Jews. By using the Holocaust as a metaphor for economic policy criticism, it diminishes the historical significance and horror of the Holocaust, which aligns with guideline 5 that identifies denying or minimizing the Holocaust as antisemitic.

4. **Inherent Hostility**: The tweet expresses hostility towards Trump by attributing extreme negative consequences to his policies in exaggerated terms. This kind of hyperbolic rhetoric can serve to fuel existing prejudices and hostilities against individuals perceived to be Jewish, given Trump's background.

While the tweet does not explicitly mention Jews or Judaism, its use of coded language, historical comparison, and implied harmful intent align with antisemitic definitions under JDA guidelines. Therefore, it qualifies as an expression of antisemitism.",0,1,0,1,0,0

To determine whether this fits the IHRA definition of antisemitism, we must analyze several components:

1. **Expression of Hatred or Hostility**: The tweet does not express hatred toward Jews or any negative sentiment directed specifically at Jewish individuals or institutions. It merely mentions that Jews are among those who have faulted Michael Dutt.

2. **Conspiracy and Scapegoating**: There is no implication of a Jewish conspiracy, nor does it blame Jews for broader societal issues (""why things go wrong""). The tweet does not attribute any wrongdoing to Jews as a collective group or imply they control media, economy, government, or other societal institutions.

3. **Double Standards and Denial of Self-Determination**: The tweet makes no claims regarding Israel's right to self-determination nor applies double standards to Israel compared to other nations. It also does not deny the Holocaust or suggest that Jewish people are inherently disloyal or have ulterior motives.

4. **Use of Stereotypes and Incitement**: There is no use of antisemitic symbols, images, or comparisons to Nazi policies. Additionally, there is no call for violence or harm against Jews.

5. **Criminal Acts or Discrimination**: The tweet does not advocate for criminal acts nor does it involve denial of opportunities or services to Jewish individuals based on their identity.

Overall, while the tweet mentions ""Jews"" in a context that may be perceived as negative by some, it lacks elements that would categorize it under antisemitic behavior according to the IHRA definition. The criticism appears to address an individual's perceived inability to entertain new ideas, rather than targeting Jews with hatred or stereotypes. Therefore, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the IHRA.",Yes,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish. The tweet in question uses a collective reference (""jews"") to describe individuals who are perceived as faulting someone for not thinking through ideas or being afraid of new ones.

1. **Collective Responsibility:** The tweet attributes negative characteristics (not thinking anything through or being afraid to entertain new ideas) collectively to Jews, which can be seen as holding them responsible for particular behaviors in a generalizing manner. This is akin to guideline 7 under section B, where Jews are held collectively responsible for actions unrelated to their individual behavior.

2. **Negative Stereotyping:** The tweet implies that Jews, as a group, share certain negative traits, which aligns with the essence of essentializing or making sweeping negative generalizations about a given population (guideline 1). Such stereotyping can foster prejudice against Jewish individuals by attributing collective negative characteristics to them.

3. **Context and Judgement:** While the tweet is brief and lacks explicit antisemitic language, its context—where Jews are collectively criticized for certain intellectual traits—can be seen as a form of coded antisemitism (guideline 4). The attribution of group behavior can contribute to harmful stereotypes about Jewish people.

Thus, when analyzed through the JDA's guidelines, this tweet contains elements that could be interpreted as antisemitic due to its collective blame and negative stereotyping of Jews.",0,1,0,1,0,0

The tweet in question juxtaposes historical events like the Holocaust, slavery, and segregation with positive actions such as hiding Jews, freeing slaves, and advocating for equality. It ends by suggesting that government and laws do not necessarily align with human morality and decency.

To determine whether this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, we need to consider several key aspects:

1. **Context and Content:** The tweet references the Holocaust as a legal fact at the time it occurred, which does not deny or trivialize the genocide. Instead, it uses this historical context to highlight moral actions taken by individuals who opposed systemic injustices.

2. **Intent and Implication:** There is no indication in the tweet that Jews are being blamed for any wrongdoing, nor is there any use of stereotypes or demonizing language aimed at Jewish people as a collective group. The focus appears to be on critiquing legal systems historically rather than targeting Jews specifically.

3. **Comparison with IHRA Examples:** The IHRA definition provides examples of antisemitism that include denying the Holocaust, using dehumanizing allegations against Jews, and accusing Jews of conspiracies or dual loyalties. None of these elements are present in the tweet.

4. **Moral Argument vs. Antisemitic Content:** While some might interpret the juxtaposition as controversial or provocative, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under IHRA's guidelines. The message critiques historical legality and highlights moral courage without attributing blame or using negative stereotypes against Jewish people.

In conclusion, while the tweet could be seen as provocative by drawing parallels between past legal systems and current issues of morality and law, it does not contain elements that align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Therefore, according to the provided criteria, it is not considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) for several reasons:

1. **Denial and Minimization of the Holocaust**: The tweet compares the legality of the Holocaust, slavery, and segregation as if they were all equivalent legal practices at some point in history. This minimizes the unique nature of the Holocaust, which was a deliberate genocide aimed specifically at annihilating Jews, along with other groups deemed undesirable by Nazi ideology. According to guideline 5 of the JDA, denying or minimizing the Holocaust by claiming it did not take place, or suggesting that it is on par with other historical legal injustices like slavery and segregation, is considered antisemitic.

2. **Contextual Implications**: While the tweet does not explicitly target Jews today, it uses historical events involving Jewish suffering to make a broader point about legality and morality. This indirect approach can still be seen as undermining the unique severity of the Holocaust by equating it with other forms of racial injustice that do not involve genocide.

3. **Instrumentalization for Political Means**: The tweet’s comparison might serve to downplay the significance of Jewish suffering during the Holocaust, which is a characteristic aspect of antisemitic rhetoric according to JDA guidelines 2 and 4. This can be seen as an attempt to diminish the historical reality and moral weight of the Holocaust in contemporary discussions about law and morality.

Always the way it is the more religious you are the more you tend to be conservative,No,"The tweet in question states that ""almost 99% of orthodox Jews vote republican"" and suggests a correlation between religious observance among Jews and conservative political leanings. To evaluate whether this statement is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we need to consider several factors outlined in the definition:

1. **Perception as Hatred**: The IHRA defines antisemitism as a perception of Jews that may be expressed as hatred. This tweet does not express hatred toward Jews; it merely comments on voting patterns among different groups within the Jewish community.

2. **Stereotyping and Generalization**: While the statement makes a generalization about Orthodox Jews, it does not engage in dehumanizing, demonizing, or employing sinister stereotypes. It discusses political behavior rather than attributing negative characteristics to Jews as a whole.

3. **Conspiracy or Blame**: The tweet does not attribute any conspiracy or blame Jewish people for societal problems, nor does it suggest that Jews are responsible for ""why things go wrong.""

4. **Holocaust Denial and Historical Negationism**: There is no denial of the Holocaust or historical negationism present in the statement.

5. **Double Standards and Comparisons to Nazis**: The tweet does not apply double standards to Israel, nor does it compare Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.

6. **Collective Responsibility**: While it mentions a group within the Jewish community (Orthodox Jews), it does not hold them collectively responsible for actions outside their control or unrelated issues.

7. **Criminal Acts and Discrimination**: The tweet does not advocate for criminal acts against Jews, nor does it deny services or opportunities to Jewish individuals based on their identity.

In summary, while the tweet makes a broad generalization about political behavior among Orthodox Jews, it does not meet the criteria set by the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It lacks elements such as hatred, dehumanizing stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or historical negationism that are central to the IHRA's understanding of antisemitic expressions. Therefore, according to the provided definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the guidelines of the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Here's a breakdown based on JDA’s criteria:

1. **Sweeping Generalizations and Essentializing** (Guideline 1): The tweet makes sweeping generalizations about Jewish voting behavior by suggesting that nearly all orthodox Jews vote Republican, while those who are unorthodox or non-practicing tend to vote liberal. This essentializes political beliefs as inherent in religious identity, which aligns with the JDA’s definition of antisemitism.

2. **Indirect Hostility** (Guideline 3): By implying that there is a monolithic voting behavior among Jews based on their level of religiosity, the tweet indirectly promotes stereotypes and could contribute to prejudice against certain segments of Jewish people who do not fit this characterization.

3. **Collective Responsibility or Stereotyping** (Guideline 7): The statement holds Jews collectively responsible for political affiliations based on religious observance. This can be seen as treating them as a homogenous group with uniform beliefs, which is a form of stereotyping and aligns with the antisemitic notion of collective responsibility outlined in JDA's guidelines.

4. **Contextual Judgment** (Guideline 4): Even though the statement does not explicitly use hate speech, it employs coded language to discuss political affiliations within a specific community, indirectly reinforcing negative stereotypes about Jewish identity based on religious practice.

This includes actions like making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective group.

In this tweet, while Arabs, Jews, Indians, and the Chinese are collectively mentioned in terms of having demonstrated hatred towards black people, there is no specific allegation made against Jews that falls under the antisemitic behaviors outlined by the IHRA definition. The statement does not attribute any negative characteristics or actions specifically to Jewish individuals or suggest a conspiracy involving Jews. It treats all four groups equally regarding their alleged behavior.

Therefore, while the tweet may be considered offensive or inappropriate due to its generalization and failure to address racism in an accurate or constructive manner, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. The tweet does not specifically target Jewish individuals or communities with hate speech, stereotypes, or conspiracy theories that would categorize it as antisemitic under the provided guidelines.",Yes,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. The tweet in question suggests that ""the Arabs, Jews, Indians and the Chinese"" have demonstrated a degree of hatred towards black people equal to that of racism originating from the Caucasian west.

1. **Essentializing or Generalizing:** The tweet makes a sweeping negative generalization about multiple groups, including Jews, by implying they share an inherent characteristic—specifically, an ""equal degree and intensity of hatred for black people."" This aligns with guideline A.1 in the JDA, which states that essentializing or making broad negative generalizations is part of antisemitism.

2. **Linking Groups to Evil:** Although not directly invoking classical themes like linking Jews to evil forces (as described in guideline A.2), the tweet places Jews within a narrative that associates them with racism and hatred. This can indirectly perpetuate harmful stereotypes by grouping Jews with negative actions without nuance or context, which is similar to attributing malign traits.

3. **Instrumentalization of Stereotypes:** The tweet instrumentalizes antisemitic tendencies described in guideline A.2, where the notion of a Jewish conspiracy or collective malice could be invoked through generalized accusations about groups' behaviors.

Overall, while the tweet does not explicitly contain language solely targeting Jews with classic antisemitic tropes (such as conspiracies or inherent evil), its broad generalization that includes Jews among those accused of hatred contributes to prejudicial and hostile narratives. This aligns with aspects of antisemitism as defined by the JDA because it treats Jews collectively and negatively without evidence, fitting into broader patterns of prejudice against them.

The tweet in question states: ""The way y’all have all this smoke for Jews but not the evangelical Christians and Anglo-Saxon billionaires who run this country is proof that people are brainwashed (and letting their own religion blind them)."" 

To determine if this statement aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, let's analyze it against the key components outlined:

1. **Perception of Jews as a collectivity:** The tweet implies criticism of societal focus or scrutiny on Jewish individuals by comparing them to evangelical Christians and Anglo-Saxon billionaires. While it does mention Jews collectively, there is no evidence in this statement alone that suggests hatred towards Jews.

2. **Expressions of antisemitism:** 
   - **Hatred toward Jews or negative stereotypes:** The tweet does not directly express hatred, use dehumanizing language, or employ sinister stereotypes about Jews.
   - **Mendacious or demonizing allegations:** There are no false claims or demonizing statements made specifically about Jewish people in the tweet.
   - **Blaming Jews for societal issues:** While it references different groups, there is no implication that Jews are responsible for any wrongdoing or negative circumstances.

3. **Examples provided by IHRA:** 
   - The examples list various forms of antisemitic expression such as conspiracy theories, denying the Holocaust, applying double standards to Israel, and using classic antisemitic symbols. None of these elements are present in the tweet.

4. **Comparison with Israel or Jews:** The statement does not draw comparisons between Jewish people and Nazis, nor does it hold Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the state of Israel.

In conclusion, while the tweet expresses a viewpoint on perceived double standards or differential treatment in society's focus, it lacks the specific antisemitic elements outlined by the IHRA definition. It is critical to note that assessing intent or context might require more information than what the text alone provides; however, based solely on the content provided, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",Yes,"The tweet appears to convey several elements that align with the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition and guidelines for antisemitic content. Firstly, the mention of ""smoke for Jews"" suggests an implication that there is a conspiracy or undue focus on Jewish people in a negative context, which can be linked to the idea of Jews being associated with hidden powers or control. This aligns with guideline 2 under General Guidelines, where such notions of Jewish influence are considered antisemitic.

Additionally, by contrasting this supposed ""smoke"" for Jews with evangelical Christians and Anglo-Saxon billionaires who are implied to have significant control (""who run this country""), the tweet indirectly suggests that Jews may possess disproportionate power or influence without acknowledging any actual basis. This can be seen as an instrumentalization of traditional antisemitic tropes involving Jewish conspiracy theories.

Moreover, the phrase ""proof that people are brainwashed (and letting their own religion blind them)"" hints at a manipulative force attributed to Jewish individuals or groups, further reinforcing stereotypes about hidden Jewish control over societal narratives. This aligns with guideline 4 under General Guidelines, where antisemitism can be coded and indirect but still recognizable through context.

The tweet in question states: ""These self-styled anti-racists want to 'critique' the Jews' right to self-determination in their historic homeland. If there's one thing I've learned over the last five years, it's that 'anti-racism' on the extreme left is a byword for antisemitism.""

To determine whether this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we need to analyze its content in light of the examples provided:

1. **Critiquing Self-Determination:** The tweet mentions ""critique"" concerning Jews' right to self-determination in their historic homeland (Israel). Criticism of Israel's policies can be legitimate and similar to criticism directed at other countries; such critiques are not inherently antisemitic unless they cross into the realm of double standards or demonization, which is not explicitly done here.

2. **General Assertion about Anti-Racism:** The tweet makes a general assertion that ""anti-racism"" on the extreme left equates to antisemitism. This statement does not provide specific examples of actions or rhetoric against Jews as such but rather critiques an ideological position without direct antisemitic content.

3. **No Specific Stereotypes or Allegations:** The tweet does not include any of the stereotypes, allegations, or demonizing language outlined in the IHRA definition (such as conspiracy myths, dehumanizing imagery, etc.).

4. **Context and Implication:** While the tweet implies a link between certain forms of anti-racism and antisemitism, it stops short of making specific accusations against Jews or Israelis that would align with any of the detailed examples in the IHRA definition.

In summary, while the tweet suggests skepticism towards certain political critiques related to Israel, it does not engage in language or actions explicitly listed under the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. Thus, based on the content provided, it is not classified as antisemitic according to that specific framework.",Yes,"** 

The tweet suggests that individuals claiming to be ""anti-racists"" on the extreme left aim to ""critique"" the Jews' right to self-determination in their historic homeland. This assertion implies a collective responsibility or criticism of Jewish people for Israel's existence and policies, which can align with antisemitic tropes.

1. **Collective Responsibility (Guideline 7):** The tweet could be interpreted as holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions and policies of Israel by questioning their right to self-determination. This is a classic aspect of antisemitism where Jews are seen as agents or representatives of Israeli policy simply because they are Jewish.

2. **Questioning Self-Determination (Guideline 10):** The tweet appears to challenge or critique the fundamental principle that allows Jews in Israel to exist and flourish collectively. By framing the right to self-determination as something subject to ""critique"" by anti-racists, it could be seen as indirectly denying this right.

3. **Generalization and Context (Guideline 4):** The tweet implies that any critique of Jewish self-determination from these groups is inherently antisemitic. This may reflect a coded message that positions those critiquing Israel's policies as being motivated by antisemitism, which can be seen as an attempt to stifle legitimate debate or criticism by labeling it as inherently antisemitic.

While the tweet does not explicitly use classic antisemitic language or imagery, its implications and context align with certain antisemitic narratives identified in the JDA guidelines. The suggestion that questioning Jewish self-determination is intrinsically linked to antisemitism can be seen as a form of coded speech intended to stigmatize legitimate political discourse.",0,1,0,1,0,0

The tweet states, ""@NYGovCuomo Please do something!!! Thousands protesting but not practicing safety!!!! Same way Jews couldn’t gather because of the pandemic and were threatened.""

1. **Perception of Jews:** The tweet references Jewish people in the context of their inability to gather due to the pandemic. However, this reference does not express hatred or a negative perception that targets Jews as a group.

2. **Condemnation or Criticism:** The comparison made is between two groups (protesters and Jews during the pandemic) regarding adherence to safety measures rather than attributing any harmful intention or conspiracy to Jews. This falls under general criticism without antisemitic intent.

3. **Criminal Acts or Discrimination:** There are no elements of criminal acts, such as violence, harassment, or incitement against Jewish people or property. The tweet also does not deny opportunities or services to Jews; instead, it draws a parallel in a context that lacks malicious undertones.

4. **Use of Stereotypes and Negative Traits:** The tweet does not employ antisemitic stereotypes, such as blaming Jews for societal problems, alleging conspiracies, or using historical slurs like blood libel.

5. **Contextual Analysis:** In the broader context, the tweet appears to be a plea for government intervention regarding public health measures during protests, rather than an expression of prejudice against Jewish people. It compares safety compliance issues without implying that Jews are responsible for any wrongdoing or conspiracy.

In summary, while the tweet references Jews in discussing pandemic restrictions, it does not meet the IHRA criteria for antisemitism as there is no expressed hatred, use of harmful stereotypes, or intent to discriminate against Jews. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",Yes,"**

The tweet in question makes an analogy between people protesting without practicing safety and Jews during the pandemic, who were allegedly threatened. This comparison can be interpreted as antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) for several reasons:

1. **Essentializing and Generalization:** The tweet seems to draw a direct comparison between two different groups' behavior—protesters and Jews during COVID-19. By doing so, it might be interpreted as essentializing or making sweeping generalizations about Jewish people, which is highlighted in guideline 1 as akin to racism.

2. **Linkage with Historical Context:** The mention of ""threatened"" when referring to how Jews couldn't gather during the pandemic could evoke historical antisemitic narratives where Jews have been depicted as being unfairly persecuted or targeted by broader society (guideline 2). This can reinforce harmful stereotypes and imply a conspiratorial victimization of Jewish people.

3. **Context and Judgement:** According to guideline 4, identifying coded speech is crucial, especially within context. The tweet indirectly evokes historical antisemitic tropes about Jews being restricted or threatened in communal practices, which could be seen as a form of indirect antisemitism.

Overall, the tweet employs elements that align with JDA's definition by potentially essentializing Jewish behavior during the pandemic and drawing on negative stereotypes and historical contexts. This makes it fall under what could be considered antisemitic according to the guidelines provided by the JDA.",0,1,0,1,0,0

Seriously does she think about what she says ever? https://t.co/R0QRsTNajW",No,"The tweet in question compares the United States to a ""Socialist regime that killed millions of Jews,"" which appears to be a reference to Nazi Germany, without explicitly targeting Jewish people or Judaism. According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, antisemitic acts include making dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective and drawing comparisons of contemporary regimes to that of the Nazis with an implicit or explicit implication regarding Jews.

However, in this tweet, there is no specific mention or implication of Jews being collectively responsible for any wrongdoing nor are Jews directly targeted. The comparison made by the author seems to be more focused on critiquing political systems rather than making statements about Jewish people as a group. This critique does not fall under the IHRA examples such as denying the Holocaust, blaming Jews for societal problems, or applying double standards specifically against Israel based on its actions.

For this tweet to be considered antisemitic by the IHRA definition, it would need to include elements like demonizing allegations about Jews collectively or drawing Nazi comparisons in a way that implicitly targets Jewish people or their historical suffering. The tweet lacks these components and instead appears to critique political ideologies without directly implicating Jewish individuals or communities. Therefore, based on the provided information, this tweet does not meet the IHRA criteria for antisemitism.",Yes,"**

The tweet in question compares the United States to ""a Socialist regime that killed millions of Jews all while invading all of Europe and trying to take over the world."" This comparison implicitly invokes imagery associated with Nazi Germany, which is a classic antisemitic trope. Here’s how it aligns with the guidelines from the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA):

1. **Linkage to Evil Forces:** The tweet links Jews to the idea of historical suffering under a regime that was explicitly anti-Semitic and committed genocide against Jews during World War II. By invoking Nazi Germany, the tweet plays into stereotypes about Jews being perpetual victims or associated with evil forces, aligning with guideline 2 of the JDA.

2. **Instrumentalization by Political Causes:** The language used is charged and appears to be politically motivated, possibly aiming to discredit Jemele Hill by associating her with Nazism indirectly. This instrumentalizes antisemitic imagery for a political purpose, which is mentioned in guideline 2 as a continuation of the idea that Jews are linked to evil forces.

3. **Coded Language:** While not explicitly antisemitic, the tweet uses coded language that can evoke antisemitic associations. By mentioning ""killed millions of Jews,"" it invokes Holocaust imagery without directly targeting Jews today but rather indirectly through political comparison, which could be interpreted as using historical antisemitism to stigmatize or delegitimize someone's political stance.

Given these points, the tweet can be seen as utilizing classical antisemitic tropes and coded language to make a political point about Jemele Hill, thereby fitting within the definition of antisemitism according to the JDA.",0,1,0,1,0,0

To determine if this is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we need to consider whether it involves a certain perception of Jews expressed as hatred or includes any stereotypical allegations about Jews. 

1. **Targeting Jews:** The tweet mentions an event at a ""Jews For Trump rally,"" which could be seen as targeting Jewish individuals. However, merely mentioning that the incident involved Jews does not inherently make it antisemitic.

2. **Hatred or Demonization:** There is no explicit expression of hatred towards Jews in this statement. It focuses on an individual act by someone identified as Antifa against a child at a rally. The tweet criticizes Antifa rather than Jewish people or expressing negative stereotypes about them.

3. **Stereotypical Allegations and Conspiracy Myths:** The IHRA definition mentions that antisemitism can involve dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews, such as conspiracy myths. This tweet does not engage with any of these themes; it merely reports an incident without attributing broader negative stereotypes to Jewish people.

4. **Context and Attribution:** While the context involves a rally associated with ""Jews For Trump,"" which might be controversial in political discourse, the content of this particular tweet attributes blame to Antifa for the act of pepper-spraying a child. It does not assign collective blame or responsibility to Jews as a group.

In summary, while the event described occurs at an event linked with Jewish individuals, the tweet itself does not contain elements that align it with antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. It criticizes Antifa for their action rather than expressing hatred or stereotypes about Jewish people.",Yes,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet in question describes an incident where someone identified with ""Antifa"" (a counter-protest group) pepper-sprayed a child at a ""Jews For Trump rally."" 

While the tweet itself does not directly express antisemitic sentiment toward Jews, it can be considered antisemitic if interpreted as encouraging hostility towards Jewish individuals by associating them negatively with Antifa's actions. Here are several points from the JDA guidelines that support this conclusion:

1. **Hostility and Violence (Guideline A3):** The tweet implies violence was directed at participants of a ""Jews For Trump rally,"" which can be seen as hostility against Jews because it identifies these individuals by their Jewish identity in the context of political affiliation.

2. **Implicit Stereotyping (Guidelines A1 & A4):** By labeling the group as ""Antifa POS"" and associating them with violence at a ""Jews For Trump rally,"" the tweet might implicitly contribute to negative stereotypes about Jews being involved in divisive or extreme political activities, even though it does not directly make sweeping generalizations.

3. **Instrumentalization of Violence (Guideline A2):** The description could be seen as instrumentalizing an act of violence against a group identified by their Jewish affiliation, which might feed into broader narratives that position Jews within contentious political landscapes in negative terms.

In summary, while the tweet does not explicitly express antisemitic beliefs or generalizations about all Jews, it can contribute to hostility toward Jews when viewed through the lens of the JDA guidelines, particularly if interpreted as endorsing violence against individuals identified by their Jewish identity at a specific event. Thus, under these considerations, the tweet could be seen as antisemitic according to the definition provided by the JDA.",0,1,0,1,0,0

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves specific attitudes and actions directed against Jews, including harmful stereotypes, conspiracy theories, and other forms of discrimination based on Jewish identity.

In this case, there is no indication from the content provided that the tweet expresses hatred or prejudice specifically towards Jews or Jewish people. Instead, it seems to employ a historical analogy meant to draw attention to a current issue by evoking empathy or understanding through comparison with past atrocities experienced by Jews. This usage does not fit into the IHRA’s examples of antisemitism, such as making mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews, denying the Holocaust, or applying double standards solely towards Israel.

However, it's important to note that while this tweet may not be classified as antisemitic under the IHRA definition, using Nazi analogies in political discourse can sometimes be problematic. It might trivialize historical suffering or cause offense without necessarily being antisemitic. Such comparisons should always be used thoughtfully and with consideration of their broader implications.

In summary, based on the provided text and within the framework of the IHRA definition, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic.",Yes,"The tweet in question appears to draw a comparison between Jews fleeing Nazis during the Holocaust and modern-day refugees, using this historical context to criticize or discredit statements made about current refugee situations. This kind of analogy can be seen as instrumentalizing the Holocaust for political purposes, which aligns with the third point under the General Guidelines (2) of the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The JDA specifies that linking Jews to evil in contemporary contexts (such as suggesting they are responsible for negative situations or outcomes) is a form of antisemitic expression.

By urging viewers to compare modern refugee crises with Holocaust imagery, the tweet may be seen as exploiting Jewish suffering to make a broader political point. This can trivialize the unique historical significance and horror of the Holocaust and might serve to deflect attention from current refugee issues by evoking emotional reactions associated with one of history's most profound tragedies.

Moreover, such comparisons can perpetuate harmful stereotypes or narratives that indirectly attribute blame or negative connotations to Jews in contemporary contexts. While not explicitly stated, the implication within this analogy could be interpreted as a coded way (Guideline 4) of linking Jewish experiences during the Holocaust to current events, thus indirectly employing classic antisemitic themes.

In conclusion, while the tweet may not directly express traditional forms of antisemitism, its use of Holocaust imagery in a potentially exploitative manner aligns with JDA's characterization of coded or instrumentalized expressions of antisemitism. Therefore, based on these considerations, the tweet can be classified as antisemitic according to the guidelines provided by the JDA.",0,1,0,1,0,0

Here's an analysis based on the provided examples of antisemitism:

1. **Conspiracy or Demonization**: The tweet does not make any dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective group or involve conspiracy theories such as those related to media control or economic power.

2. **Blame for Wrongdoing**: It does not accuse Jews of being responsible for actions committed by individuals or other groups.

3. **Holocaust Denial**: There is no mention or denial of the Holocaust in any form within this tweet.

4. **Loyalty and Self-Determination**: The tweet does not accuse Jewish citizens of dual loyalties nor deny their right to self-determination, such as through criticism of Israel’s existence.

5. **Double Standards or Comparisons to Nazism**: There is no application of double standards specifically against Jews or comparisons between contemporary Israeli policies and Nazi actions.

6. **Collective Responsibility**: The tweet does not hold Jewish individuals collectively responsible for the actions of others, whether those are individuals within their party or the state of Israel.

While the tweet could be interpreted as containing general derogatory language directed towards groups based on race (including a reference to Jews), it does not specifically include elements outlined in the IHRA definition that would classify it as antisemitic. It is important to note, however, that language targeting racial or ethnic groups can still be problematic and harmful, but according to the specific criteria of antisemitism provided by the IHRA, this tweet does not meet those standards.",Yes,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet in question contains several elements that align with this definition:

1. **Hostility towards Jews and those identified by association**: The tweet specifically targets ""the Jews"" within the party mentioned and attributes to them a group identity associated with negative behavior (""bullying""). This can be seen as hostility directed at Jews simply for being Jewish.

2. **Use of stereotypes and generalizations**: The mention of not standing people who are white, alongside targeting ""Jews in your party,"" invokes broad and sweeping characterizations that align with making generalized negative statements about a group's characteristics or intentions (Guideline 1).

3. **Implication of collective responsibility or behavior**: By addressing Jews within the party as part of an action (""bullying""), it implies they share responsibility for or are collectively engaging in this behavior, which resonates with Guideline 7 where Jews are held collectively responsible for actions that can be attributed to Israel.

4. **Context and coded language**: While there is no explicit reference to classical antisemitic symbols (as described in Guidelines 2 and 3), the context of targeting a group based on their Jewish identity, coupled with potentially inflammatory language (""bullying""), contributes to an atmosphere of hostility against Jews as Jews.

Considering these points within the framework provided by the JDA, the tweet exhibits characteristics that can be interpreted as antisemitic.

While the tweet suggests that there is a lack of understanding between Hindu and Jewish communities, it does not contain elements explicitly covered by the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. 

To determine if this statement could be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we should analyze its components:

1. **Hatred or Hostility:** The tweet expresses a form of advice rather than hatred or hostility towards Jews. It suggests that Jews need more information about Hindus, not that they are responsible for any wrongdoing.

2. **Negative Stereotypes and Allegations:** There is no mention of mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a group. The tweet does not employ negative character traits traditionally associated with antisemitic rhetoric.

3. **Conspiracy Theories:** The message does not suggest any form of conspiracy involving Jewish people harming humanity or controlling societal institutions.

4. **Blame for Wrongdoing:** It does not accuse Jews collectively for actions committed by individuals, nor does it imply responsibility for unrelated acts.

5. **Holocaust Denial or Distortion:** There is no denial, distortion, or minimization of the Holocaust mentioned in the tweet.

6. **Double Standards and Comparisons with Nazis:** The message does not apply double standards to Israel or draw comparisons between Israeli policy and that of Nazi Germany.

7. **Collective Responsibility for State Actions:** It doesn't hold Jewish people collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

While the tweet might be perceived as patronizing or insensitive by suggesting Jews lack knowledge about Hinduism, it does not fit within the parameters set out in the IHRA definition for antisemitic acts or expressions. The tone and content are advisory rather than harmful or accusatory towards Jewish individuals or communities. However, sensitivity and mutual respect should guide interactions between different cultural or religious groups to avoid misunderstandings or offense.",Yes,"** 

The tweet in question exhibits several elements that align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism, particularly under guideline 2. The message suggests that ""Jewish communities"" as a collective group need to be educated by Hindus on matters concerning themselves or their religion. This can be interpreted as holding Jews collectively responsible for understanding or addressing issues from an external perspective, which is akin to the notion described in guidelines 6 and 7 of applying stereotypes or imposing collective responsibility.

Furthermore, the tweet seems to imply a form of division between ""Jews"" and ""Hindus,"" suggesting that Hindus are allies but also possess superior knowledge or insight regarding Jewish matters. This framing can subtly reinforce a stereotype of Jews as needing guidance from others on issues related to their community, which aligns with the idea of essentializing a characteristic trait (in this case, perceived ignorance about Hinduism) as inherent in Jews.

Additionally, there is an undertone that could be interpreted as suggesting that Jewish communities are disconnected or ignorant about other religious groups, implicitly questioning their understanding or acceptance of others. This echoes the antisemitic trope of portraying Jews as insular or out of touch with broader societal dynamics.

Overall, the tweet's implication that Jews need external education by Hindus can be seen as promoting a stereotype and reinforcing collective responsibility, both of which are identified in the JDA guidelines as characteristics of antisemitism.

It also mentions Ilhan Omar and the Democratic Squad's endorsement of Bernie Sanders as detrimental to both Black and Jewish communities. To determine if this tweet is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we must consider whether it involves any elements from the provided examples.

1. **Criticizing Political Figures**: The tweet criticizes political figures for their actions or affiliations related to Israel policy but does not accuse them of antisemitism directly. Criticism of individuals' policies towards Israel does not automatically equate to antisemitism, especially if it is similar to criticism leveled against other countries.

2. **Double Standards and Comparisons**: The tweet implies a double standard by suggesting that these political figures have failed the Jewish community. However, there is no explicit application of double standards in terms of expectations from Israel or any other country as defined by IHRA.

3. **Collective Blame**: There is an expression of disappointment with certain politicians for perceived failures related to policies impacting Jewish and Black communities. This does not equate to blaming Jews collectively for the actions of political figures, nor does it accuse Jewish individuals of wrongdoing based on stereotypes or conspiracy theories.

4. **Negative Allegations or Stereotypes**: The tweet does not employ dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective group, such as controlling institutions or conspiracies against humanity.

5. **Holocaust Denial or Distortion**: There is no mention of denying or distorting the Holocaust in any form within this tweet.

6. **Right to Self-Determination**: The tweet does not deny the right of Jewish people to self-determine through a state of Israel, nor does it label Israel’s existence as inherently racist.

In conclusion, while the tweet expresses political dissatisfaction and disappointment with certain figures regarding their stance on Israel, it does not meet the IHRA definition of antisemitism. It lacks elements such as stereotyping, conspiracy myths, Holocaust denial, or collective blame that characterize antisemitic expressions according to the IHRA examples.",Yes,"** The tweet contains elements that can be interpreted as antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Collective Responsibility and Hostility:** The tweet accuses Nancy Pelosi, Charles Schumer, and Karen Bass of betraying Jewish people by aligning with J Street or supporting Ilhan Omar, implying that certain political actions equate to betrayal against Jews as a collective group. This echoes the guideline (7) from the JDA which states it is antisemitic to hold Jews collectively responsible for the conduct of Israel.

2. **Hostility and Antagonism:** The tweet also suggests that progressive politics, associated with figures like Bernie Sanders endorsed by ""the Squad,"" has failed Black and Jewish communities. This framing implies a negative stereotype about progressive politicians being antagonistic towards Jewish interests. Although not explicitly linking Jews to evil, it contributes to an environment of hostility toward the Jewish community based on political affiliations.

3. **Contextual Coded Language:** The tweet uses coded language by emphasizing betrayal by specific political figures and groups associated with certain stances on Israel (e.g., J Street). This can be seen as instrumentalizing antisemitic tropes about Jews being disloyal or overly influential in political matters, which aligns with guideline (4) regarding coded antisemitism.

These dumbos don’t realise that Hindutva urges Muslims to acknowledge that we have common ancestry and want to be one people while Nazis said opposite.,No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly meet the IHRA definition of antisemitism based on the examples and descriptions provided. It primarily discusses comparisons between Hindutva adherents and Nazis, as well as Muslims and Jews during Nazi Germany. While it criticizes certain scholars for these comparisons, there is no clear indication that the criticism is rooted in or contributes to a ""certain perception of Jews"" involving hatred towards them.

The tweet does not include any allegations, stereotypes, or harmful rhetoric specifically targeting Jewish individuals, their community institutions, or religious facilities. It does not engage in demonizing, dehumanizing, or attributing conspiratorial behavior to Jews as a collective group. Additionally, it avoids denying the Holocaust or accusing Jewish people of responsibility for actions committed by non-Jews.

However, it is important to note that while this specific tweet may not be antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, the context and implications of such comparisons can still be sensitive. Comparing any contemporary political ideology with Nazism carries potential risks of trivializing historical atrocities or oversimplifying complex social issues, though this does not inherently constitute antisemitism per se.

In summary, based on the IHRA criteria provided, the tweet does not manifest antisemitic behavior as it lacks expressions of hatred, stereotypes, or harmful accusations specifically against Jews.",Yes,"**

The tweet in question compares the treatment of Muslims with Jews during the Nazi regime, suggesting that Hindutva ideology urges Muslims to acknowledge a common ancestry. This comparison can be seen as engaging in indirect antisemitism under the guidelines provided by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

1. **Indirect and Coded Speech:** According to guideline 4 of the JDA, antisemitism can manifest in coded language, often depending on context and judgement. The tweet uses a comparison between Hindutva supporters and Nazis, which could be interpreted as downplaying or trivializing Nazi actions against Jews by suggesting that similar treatment is occurring towards Muslims under the current regime. This minimizes the historical severity of Nazi crimes, aligning with guideline 5, which identifies Holocaust denial or minimization as antisemitic.

2. **Historical Context and Denial:** By comparing contemporary political dynamics to those of Nazi Germany in a way that seems to minimize the unique and systemic extermination of Jews, the tweet risks engaging in an indirect form of Holocaust denial. The comparison might imply that Muslims are similarly persecuted or dehumanized as Jews were by Nazis, which can diminish the specific historical atrocities committed against Jewish people.

3. **Contextual Judgement:** In making a comparison to Nazi Germany's treatment of Jews, and equating it with contemporary political rhetoric about Hindutva and Muslims, there is an implicit trivialization of the unique nature of antisemitism as described in guideline 2. This can be interpreted as perpetuating harmful stereotypes or reducing the historical specificity and gravity of antisemitic actions during the Holocaust.

Given these points, the tweet aligns with indirect forms of antisemitism under the JDA's framework by engaging in coded language that potentially minimizes the unique historical context of antisemitism, specifically relating to the Holocaust.

Instead, the tweet comments on social and economic issues affecting various racial and ethnic groups, suggesting that these groups combined cannot reach the ""blacks killing blacks body count."" It implies a commentary on societal issues rather than an attack based on antisemitic stereotypes or conspiracy theories.

The IHRA definition of antisemitism includes elements such as making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews, accusing them collectively of wrongdoing, denying the Holocaust, and other specific actions against Jewish individuals or institutions. The tweet does not engage in these activities; it lacks any reference to Jews conspiring, controlling societal institutions, or being responsible for negative outcomes beyond its statement on socio-economic status.

Furthermore, while the tweet mentions ""poor Jews"" as one among several groups facing poverty, it does so without implicating them in a conspiracy or attributing blame to Jews collectively for broader social issues. This distinction is crucial because antisemitism involves specific accusations or stereotypes against Jewish people as a collective entity.

Therefore, based on the content and context of this tweet, it does not meet the IHRA criteria for being classified as an expression of antisemitism.",Yes,"** The tweet in question appears to fall under the category of antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Here’s a breakdown based on the JDA guidelines:

1. **General Context and Coded Language**: The tweet implies that Jews, among other groups, are collectively responsible for societal issues—in this case, violence against Black individuals. This aligns with guideline 7 of the JDA, which states that holding Jews collectively responsible for actions or attributing certain behaviors to them as a group is considered antisemitic.

2. **Use of Stereotypes**: The tweet indirectly plays into stereotypes by suggesting that issues like crime rates are due to inherent characteristics rather than socioeconomic factors, similar to guideline 1 about essentializing or making sweeping negative generalizations.

3. **Hostility and Prejudice as Jews**: While the tweet does not explicitly use antisemitic language or symbols (as per guidelines 2 and 3), it conveys hostility by singling out Jews among other groups in a way that contributes to harmful stereotypes about Jewish influence or responsibility over societal issues, which can be seen as aligning with classical antisemitic themes of conspiracy and control.

The tweet in question criticizes a person (or persons) for not advancing peace and suggests that they have endangered Jews without providing specific evidence or context for these claims.

1. **Targeting Individuals or Groups:** The tweet targets an individual or individuals, accusing them of endangering Jews but does not target the Jewish community as a whole. It focuses on specific actions attributed to certain people rather than making general allegations against Jews or Jewish institutions.

2. **Use of Stereotypes and Demonization:** The IHRA definition emphasizes antisemitism when it involves dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotyping Jews as a collective group. This tweet does not employ such stereotypes or accusations; instead, it criticizes specific individuals' actions without resorting to harmful generalizations about Jewish people.

3. **Blame for Broader Issues:** The IHRA definition notes antisemitism when Jews are blamed for societal issues or conspiracies. The tweet attributes responsibility for endangering Jews to specific individuals, not to the Jewish community as a whole.

4. **Double Standards and Comparison to Nazism:** There is no indication in the tweet of double standards being applied specifically to Israel or comparisons between contemporary Israeli policy and that of the Nazis.

5. **Criminal Acts and Discrimination:** The language used does not suggest criminal acts against Jews nor discriminates against Jewish people as a group; it criticizes actions perceived as endangering peace.

While the tone is accusatory and strong, without additional context suggesting these criticisms are based on antisemitic motives or stereotypes, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the IHRA definition. It appears to be a critique of specific individuals rather than an expression of hatred towards Jews as a group.",Yes,"To determine if the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze its content against the provided definition and guidelines.

1. **Content Analysis**: The tweet accuses individuals of endangering Jews, suggesting hypocrisy in their approach to social justice issues. This type of language can carry implicit or explicit negative connotations towards Jewish people by framing them as beneficiaries of harm due to these alleged hypocritical actions.

2. **Guideline 3 (Antisemitism Manifested in Words)**: The tweet uses words that can be interpreted as expressing hostility toward individuals based on their perceived role concerning Jews, which could reflect prejudice or discrimination against Jews as a group. While the tweet does not directly mention Jews as inherently problematic, it indirectly places blame on them for being endangered by certain actions, aligning with harmful stereotypes.

3. **Guideline 2 (Linkage to Evil)**: Although the tweet does not explicitly link Jews to evil forces, the implication that Jewish safety is compromised due to others' actions might resonate with historical antisemitic tropes where Jewish people are depicted as passive victims in need of protection from external threats or conspiracies.

4. **Guideline 4 (Coded Speech)**: The tweet could be interpreted as coded speech depending on context and intention, particularly if the individuals mentioned are associated with advocacy for peace involving Israel-Palestine issues. If these advocates are Jewish, the statement might unfairly hold them collectively responsible for endangering their community, reflecting a coded form of antisemitism.

5. **Contextual Judgment**: Without additional context (such as who is being specifically targeted and their connection to Jewish identity), it is challenging to assess definitively. However, the phrasing suggests an underlying bias that could be perceived as antisemitic, particularly if it implies collective guilt or responsibility among Jews for external threats.

While Buchenwald was primarily a concentration camp rather than an extermination camp like Auschwitz-Birkenau, it was still a site where many Jews and other victims were murdered or died due to harsh conditions.

2. **Intent and Context**: The tweet's intent seems educational or informative, aiming to remember the Holocaust and acknowledge the deaths that occurred at Buchenwald. It does not make any false or misleading claims about Jewish people or the Holocaust itself.

3. **Absence of Antisemitic Elements**: There are no demonizing stereotypes, allegations of conspiracy, accusations against Jews as a collective, denial of historical facts regarding the Holocaust, or comparisons to Nazi policies aimed at Israel in this tweet. 

Overall, based on the content and context provided by the IHRA definition, this tweet does not meet any criteria for being considered antisemitic.",Yes,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), one of the clear examples of antisemitism is denying or minimizing the Holocaust. This includes claims that deny the deliberate Nazi genocide of Jews, suggest there were no extermination camps or gas chambers, or assert that the number of victims was significantly lower than historical evidence supports.

The tweet in question states: ""It is important to remember all the sites of Nazi massacre of Europe's Jews in the Holocaust. Buchenwald was not an extermination camp but 43,000 people died there."" While it acknowledges the mass deaths at Buchenwald and implies recognition of a broader Holocaust context, it inaccurately characterizes Buchenwald as ""not an extermination camp,"" which may contribute to minimizing or misunderstanding the nature of Nazi atrocities against Jews.

By implying that Buchenwald was different from other sites in terms of its function (though true in technical definition), without acknowledging that it still participated in the broader systemic genocide, there is a risk of contributing to narratives that downplay the extent and nature of Holocaust crimes. The JDA emphasizes that such misrepresentations can be antisemitic because they may serve to diminish the historical reality of the Holocaust's targeted extermination of Jews.

Therefore, while the tweet may not intend outright denial, its potential to minimize or distort the narrative about the systematic murder of Jews during the Holocaust aligns with examples of antisemitism as defined by guideline 5 in the JDA. Hence, according to these guidelines, this tweet could be considered antisemitic.",0,1,0,1,0,0

The tweet in question states that certain people are enabling actions similar to those of Hitler, resulting in a significant number of deaths. It specifically mentions the Holocaust and implies a comparison between past and present events by referencing both ""Hitler"" and ""another tyrant."" However, it does not directly target Jews as individuals or communities, nor does it employ antisemitic tropes such as conspiracy theories, demonization, stereotyping, or blaming Jews collectively for any wrongdoing.

According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, an expression must involve a certain perception of Jews that may be expressed as hatred toward them. The key components include:

1. **Targeting Jewish individuals or communities:** This tweet does not specifically target Jews; it mentions Americans who are racists and compares their actions to historical events without specifying any group as Jewish.

2. **Conspiracy theories or demonization:** There is no mention of conspiracy theories involving Jews, such as controlling media or governments, nor is there demonizing language directed at Jews.

3. **Collective blame:** The tweet does not accuse Jews collectively for the deaths mentioned or for enabling tyrannical actions.

4. **Holocaust denial or distortion:** While it references the Holocaust, the tweet does not deny or distort its facts; rather, it uses it as a historical reference point to criticize contemporary issues.

5. **Comparison to Nazi policies:** Although comparisons are made to Hitler and tyranny, these do not specifically target Israel or Jews in a manner outlined by the IHRA examples of antisemitism (e.g., comparing Israeli policy to that of Nazis).

In summary, while the tweet uses strong language related to historical events involving Jews, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. The focus is on critiquing perceived racism and tyranny without directly attributing these actions or policies to Jewish individuals or communities.",Yes,"** The tweet suggests that the actions of ""her"" (presumably referring to a Jewish individual or group, given the context) enabled Hitler's atrocities against Jews. This implies collective responsibility for an atrocity on the part of all Jews, which aligns with guideline 7 from the JDA: ""Holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct or treating Jews, simply because they are Jewish, as agents of Israel."" Although the tweet explicitly refers to historical events, it draws a parallel between past and present that involves attributing blame to a group based on their Jewish identity. This kind of reasoning is indicative of classic antisemitic tropes where Jews are collectively blamed for negative actions or events.

Moreover, by drawing a direct line from enabling Hitler's regime to modern-day situations, the tweet may indirectly suggest an inherent characteristic or influence within the Jewish community that has perpetually led to such outcomes. This aligns with guideline 2 of the JDA, which discusses the antisemitic notion of Jews being linked to negative forces or conspiracies.

The tweet also implicitly engages in a coded form of antisemitism by using historical antisemitic motifs (i.e., collective blame for genocide) in its argument against present-day figures or situations. As per guideline 4, such indirect forms of expression can be instrumentalized to convey antisemitic sentiments under the guise of political commentary.

In conclusion, while the tweet does not explicitly use classical antisemitic language, it employs rhetoric that aligns with the patterns and guidelines described in the JDA as constituting antisemitism. Thus, it is considered antisemitic according to the provided definition.",0,1,0,1,0,0

This hooked cross was made the symbol of persecution of Jews, again.\n\nAnother white racist Christian misnamed this hooked cross as Swastika - because, we Hindus are a beastly people with a beastly religion.\n\nThat is how ++",No,"The tweet in question discusses the misuse of an ancient symbol (the hooked cross) by white racists, associating it with the persecution of Jews and noting its misidentification as a swastika. This focus is primarily on historical symbolism and cultural misunderstanding rather than directly targeting Jews or Jewish institutions.

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves specific perceptions and actions directed towards Jews that include hatred, conspiracy theories, denial of the Holocaust, or accusations against Jewish people collectively for various wrongs. The tweet does not engage in any of these behaviors; instead, it highlights a perceived misappropriation and distortion of symbols by certain groups.

While it mentions white racists' association of this symbol with persecution and addresses their wrongful labeling of Hindu symbols as swastikas, it doesn't propagate stereotypes or hatred against Jews. Instead, it seems to critique the historical misuse of symbols without attributing negative characteristics or blame to Jewish people collectively.

Therefore, while the tweet touches on themes related to racism and misinterpretation of cultural symbols, it does not fit within the IHRA definition of antisemitism as it lacks direct expressions of hatred or conspiracy targeting Jews.",Yes,"** The tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) for several reasons:

1. **Historical Misrepresentation and Sensitivity**: The tweet references a symbol that became associated with the persecution of Jews, likely referring to the swastika's adoption by Nazi Germany as a symbol of hate against Jews. By discussing this in a way that could trivialize or misrepresent its historical significance, it may indirectly perpetuate stereotypes about Jewish suffering.

2. **Religious and Ethnic Insensitivity**: The tweet makes generalizations about Hindus, calling their religion ""beastly"" and labeling them as ""a beastly people."" This kind of sweeping negative generalization is akin to racism and aligns with guideline 1 of the JDA regarding essentializing character traits or making negative generalizations about a population.

3. **Potential for Hostility**: Although the tweet does not directly target Jews, it can contribute to an environment where hostility against different groups (including Jews) is normalized through insensitive comparisons and misrepresentations of historical symbols linked to antisemitism.

4. **Instrumentalization of Jewish History**: By discussing the swastika's association with persecution of Jews in a context that seems dismissive or minimizes its significance, it could be seen as instrumentalizing Jewish history for other agendas (e.g., criticizing Hindu interpretations), which aligns with guideline 2 about linking Jews to broader conspiratorial or negative narratives.

Overall, while the tweet does not explicitly target Jews, its content and implications can contribute to an environment that is dismissive of historical antisemitism and insensitive to religious and ethnic differences, fitting within the broader framework of what can be considered antisemitic according to the JDA.",0,1,0,1,0,0
1317527914288713728,AshanteIUP,2020-10-17 18:08:27+00:00,0,Jews,"Tomorrow, join Bernard Harrison in the virtual launch of his new book, BLAMING THE JEWS: POLITICS AND DELUSION.\n\nIn it, Harrison offers an analysis of the persistent cultural delusion that ""the Jews"" collectively dominate world affairs.\n\nAll the details: https://t.co/hnOH0KlACZ https://t.co/hhaWG5PvAz",No,"The tweet itself does not inherently express antisemitism according to the IHRA definition, but rather promotes a book that analyzes what is described as a ""persistent cultural delusion"" regarding Jewish influence in world affairs. Several points are essential for this assessment:

1. **Context of Promotion**: The tweet is promoting a book titled ""BLAMING THE JEWS: POLITICS AND DELUSION,"" suggesting an exploration or analysis rather than outright endorsement or expression of antisemitic beliefs.

2. **Language Used**: The phrase ""persistent cultural delusion that 'the Jews' collectively dominate world affairs"" does not in itself constitute antisemitism. It indicates the topic of discussion in the book, which could be addressing and deconstructing this idea rather than propagating it.

3. **Intent and Content**: Without access to the content of the book or additional context regarding its perspective, we cannot definitively categorize the tweet as antisemitic. The intent appears to be informative about a specific viewpoint, potentially critical of the very notion it references.

4. **IHRA Criteria**: According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves certain perceptions and expressions that manifest as hatred towards Jews or are based on harmful stereotypes. The tweet does not directly express hatred, dehumanize, or demonize Jews; rather, it introduces a topic for discussion in an academic context.

5. **Potential Misinterpretation**: While some might perceive the subject matter of the book as sensitive or controversial, promoting critical analysis and debate around societal perceptions is generally considered part of scholarly discourse unless it explicitly endorses harmful stereotypes or false allegations.

In conclusion, based solely on the content of the tweet and without additional context from the book itself, there is insufficient evidence to label the tweet antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. It primarily serves as an announcement for a publication that explores a particular viewpoint regarding Jewish influence in world affairs.",Yes,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. Specifically, it highlights the notion of Jews being linked with negative stereotypes such as controlling world affairs through a conspiracy, which is central to classic antisemitic ideology.

The tweet promotes Bernard Harrison's book titled ""BLAMING THE JEWS: POLITICS AND DELUSION,"" which claims to analyze ""the persistent cultural delusion that 'the Jews' collectively dominate world affairs."" This directly aligns with the core of classic antisemitism as defined by JDA, specifically point 2 under Guidelines A. It refers to an alleged Jewish conspiracy and hidden power used for a collective agenda—elements identified in JDA's definition of antisemitic stereotypes.

While the book may argue against or critically analyze this belief, its promotion via the tweet does not negate its potential alignment with antisemitic themes. Thus, according to the JDA guidelines, the promotion of such content is considered antisemitic because it engages with and spreads a stereotype central to antisemitic thought.",0,1,0,1,0,0

It draws a comparison between criticism directed at different groups (Jews, gays, people of color) with criticism directed at religious figures, particularly using ""our prophet"" as an example. While it highlights perceived inconsistencies in how freedom of speech is applied to criticisms of different groups, it does not specifically engage in antisemitic behavior or rhetoric.

The tweet makes a statement about what the user perceives as double standards in criticizing certain communities while defending others under the banner of free speech. It does not include any dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations against Jews. There is no accusation against Jews collectively for real or imagined wrongdoing, nor does it deny historical events like the Holocaust.

Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism because it lacks elements such as hatred towards Jews, dehumanization, conspiracy theories involving Jewish people, or denial of their rights and experiences. The focus is on a critique of perceived inconsistencies in freedom of expression rather than targeting Jewish individuals or groups specifically.",Yes,"** The tweet in question is considered antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) for several reasons:

1. **Implicit Equivalence and Minimization**: The tweet attempts to draw an equivalence between criticism of Jews as inherently antisemitic and criticism of other groups, such as gays or people of color, with their respective forms of prejudice. This comparison minimizes the specific historical context and unique nature of antisemitism by implying that all criticisms are equivalent regardless of intent, impact, or history.

2. **Indirect Denial**: By suggesting that speaking about Jews in any critical capacity is automatically antisemitic, the tweet indirectly denies the legitimate grounds for discussing issues related to Jewish individuals or communities separately from their collective identity. This can be seen as undermining the specific protections against discrimination and prejudice directed at Jews, which are rooted in a long history of systemic and institutionalized hatred.

3. **Contextual Sensitivity**: According to guideline 4 of the JDA, antisemitism can manifest indirectly and be coded. The context here implies that any critical discussion about Jewish people is automatically prejudiced or hostile, akin to an indirect suggestion that Jews cannot be critiqued in a manner consistent with how other groups might be discussed (e.g., political ideologies or specific behaviors).

4. **Instrumentalization of Prejudice**: By equating the critique of Jewish individuals with bigotry against other groups, while allowing for derogatory speech about religious figures without condemnation, the tweet supports a double standard that instrumentalizes prejudice selectively. This aligns with antisemitic rhetoric by suggesting an inherent bias or conspiracy among Jews and insinuating they should not be subject to criticism in the same way others might be.

The overall tone and implications of the tweet foster an environment where legitimate discussions about Jewish individuals, communities, or issues can be dismissed as inherently prejudiced, thus aligning with antisemitic patterns outlined by the JDA.",0,1,0,1,0,0

The tweet appears to be a concise statement, possibly referring to some policy or action taken by Byron York that affects both swimmers and Orthodox Jews. However, without additional information about the nature of these actions, their implications, or the intent behind them, it's challenging to ascertain whether this could reflect antisemitism.

To evaluate antisemitism according to the IHRA definition, one would need to determine if there is any perception of Jews that expresses hatred, employs stereotypes, or attributes harmful characteristics specifically to Jews as a group. The tweet does not include language that indicates hate, employs stereotypes, or makes allegations about Jewish people controlling various aspects of society.

Furthermore, for an action or statement to be considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition, it must involve negative characterizations such as conspiracy theories, dehumanizing claims, demonization, or denial of Jewish suffering and history. The tweet does not provide any evidence of these elements being present.

In cases like this, where there is limited information, context is crucial to understanding whether a statement could be perceived as discriminatory or hateful. If further content surrounding the tweet revealed intent to harm, delegitimize, or discriminate against Jews specifically because they are Jewish, then it might fall under antisemitic behavior. However, with only the given text, it cannot be conclusively categorized as such according to the IHRA definition.",Yes,"The tweet ""@ByronYork Tough on swimmers AND Orthodox Jews"" could be interpreted as antisemitic under the guidelines of the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) for several reasons:

1. **Implicit Negative Stereotyping**: By grouping ""swimmers"" with ""Orthodox Jews,"" the tweet may invoke negative stereotypes, particularly if it implies that Orthodox Jews are being unfairly targeted or viewed negatively in a manner similar to an unrelated group (""swimmers""). This could resonate with antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish behavior or presence.

2. **Context and Potential Connotation**: Without additional context, the pairing of these two groups can be perceived as coded language that subtly perpetuates negative connotations or prejudice against Jews. If ""Orthodox Jews"" are being criticized or targeted unjustly in a way that parallels the treatment of an unrelated group (like swimmers), it might echo historical antisemitic practices of singling out Jewish communities for disproportionate scrutiny or criticism.

3. **Instrumentalization and Hostility**: The tweet may imply hostility towards Orthodox Jews, depending on how ""tough"" is interpreted within its context. If ""tough on"" suggests unfair or hostile treatment, this could align with the JDA's definition of antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, or hostility against Jews.

4. **Absence of Direct Antisemitic Language**: The tweet does not use overtly antisemitic language (e.g., conspiracy theories or Holocaust denial) but relies on a coded message that requires context to interpret fully. This aligns with guideline 4 of the JDA, which states that antisemitism can be indirect and coded.

Overall, while the tweet itself is brief and lacks explicit content, its structure and potential implications could contribute to an environment where prejudice or hostility against Jews is fostered, fitting within the broader definition of antisemitism outlined in the JDA.",0,1,0,1,0,0

While it accuses someone of making a racist statement about Jews, this alone does not meet the IHRA definition of antisemitism as outlined above.

According to the IHRA working definition, antisemitism involves actions or expressions that exhibit hostility towards Jews because they are Jewish. This includes manifestations such as hatred, dehumanizing stereotypes, conspiracy theories, denial of the Holocaust, and other specific behaviors listed in the examples provided by the IHRA.

The tweet does not contain any direct manifestation of hate speech against Jews. Instead, it seems to be calling out a statement made by another party (""@Rosenbergradio"") as racist. The content of this accusation is not provided within the tweet itself, so we cannot determine if it involves antisemitic elements like those described (e.g., conspiracy theories or dehumanizing stereotypes). 

Furthermore, the demand to have someone fired for making a racist statement does not inherently constitute an act of antisemitism; rather, it appears to be a call for accountability against racism. The tweet lacks any language or context that directly attributes negative stereotypes, hatred, or discrimination towards Jews.

Therefore, based on the information given in the tweet and its alignment with the IHRA definition, this specific message does not qualify as antisemitic according to the provided criteria.",Yes,"The tweet in question accuses someone of making ""a very racist statement about Jews"" and demands their firing, labeling the alleged statement as ""racist."" According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) Guidelines A.1, it is considered racist to essentialize or make sweeping negative generalizations about a population, including Jews. The phrase ""a very racist statement about Jews"" suggests that such a statement might involve stereotyping or negatively generalized claims against Jews as a group.

While the tweet itself doesn't provide details of the specific statement being criticized, its demand for firing based on racial grounds implies an acknowledgment of antisemitic content if indeed it involved essentializing or negative generalizations about Jews. The context provided by JDA emphasizes that both direct and indirect expressions can manifest racism and discrimination against Jews.

Therefore, considering these guidelines, the tweet aligns with recognizing antisemitism as outlined in the JDA's definition, assuming the criticized statement contained elements of racial prejudice or discrimination against Jews as a group.",0,1,0,1,0,0
