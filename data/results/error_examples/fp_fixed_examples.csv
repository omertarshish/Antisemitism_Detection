Iran promises revenge. \n\nWhere does the ultimate revenge take place? \n\nA month later in Georgia, India and Thailand where Israeli diplomats are targeted with bombs\n\nhttps://t.co/qeL7jkzQhd https://t.co/qEkQP7ddG4",Yes,"The tweet in question could be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition due to several reasons:

1. **Implication of Jewish Conspiracy**: The narrative suggests that Israel, and by extension Jews as a collective, are conspiring or engaging in covert actions leading to retaliatory violence against them. This plays into the stereotype of Jews wielding disproportionate power or influence, which aligns with the IHRA definition that notes antisemitism may involve attributing sinister stereotypes and negative character traits to Jewish people.

2. **Collective Responsibility**: The tweet seems to imply a form of collective responsibility by connecting actions taken by Israel (assumed in this case) to subsequent attacks on Israeli diplomats. This mirrors the IHRA example where antisemitism involves holding Jews collectively responsible for actions associated with Israel, thereby attributing blame or cause to Jewish people as a whole.

3. **Demonizing Actions**: By linking an act of violence directly to Israel and suggesting it provokes global repercussions specifically targeting Jewish individuals (Israeli diplomats), the tweet can be seen as demonizing Israeli and by extension Jewish actions on an international scale, which fits into the broader pattern of dehumanization or demonization that is characteristic of antisemitic rhetoric.

Overall, while not explicitly using stereotypical language, the insinuations within the context of the tweet align with several criteria outlined in the IHRA definition regarding how Jews are perceived and implicated in global events. Therefore, it can be reasonably interpreted as antisemitic.",No,"** 

The tweet references events involving an Iranian nuclear chemist's assassination, followed by retaliatory actions targeting Israeli diplomats in Georgia, India, and Thailand. To determine if this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must assess whether it fits any of the criteria outlined:

1. **General Guidelines:**
   - The tweet does not make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews as a whole or essentialize their character traits.
   - It does not associate Jews with evil, nor does it suggest a Jewish conspiracy controlling events.

2. **Manifestation in Words/Deeds:**
   - There is no direct hostility towards Jews or Jewish institutions expressed in the tweet. The focus is on geopolitical actions and consequences rather than attributing any blame to Jewish individuals or groups collectively.
  
3. **Direct or Indirect Speech:**
   - Although it discusses an incident involving Israel, the context does not imply that Jews as a group are responsible for Israel's conduct (as per guideline 7), nor does it suggest negative stereotypes about Jews.

4. **Denial of Holocaust or Distortion of History:**
   - The tweet contains no historical denial or distortion related to the Holocaust or Jewish history.

5. **Israel and Palestine Specific Guidelines:**
   - Applying classical antisemitic symbols or stereotypes (guideline 6) does not occur in this context.
   - While it mentions an event involving Israel, there is no implication of collective responsibility for Jews (guideline 7), nor any requirement for Jews to condemn Israel (guideline 8).
   - The tweet neither denies the right of Jewish people in Israel to exist and flourish (guideline 10) nor engages in other forms of direct or indirect antisemitism.

Overall, while discussing geopolitical tensions involving Israel, the content of this tweet does not align with any antisemitic criteria as defined by the JDA. It focuses on specific incidents without attributing blame to Jewish people collectively or employing antisemitic stereotypes.",1,0,1,0,0,0

It makes a mendacious and demonizing allegation about Israel, suggesting that Israeli soldiers deliberately killed an 8-year-old child named Malek Issa as part of their standard behavior. This kind of claim aligns with several key aspects outlined in the IHRA examples of antisemitic manifestations:

1. **Demonization and Dehumanization**: The tweet employs a dehumanizing allegation by implying that Israeli soldiers inherently engage in violent actions against individuals, particularly children. It suggests malice on the part of Israeli forces without evidence, which fits into the category of demonizing Jews or Jewish institutions.

2. **Conspiracy-like Allegations**: By asserting that ""it's what israeli soldiers do,"" the tweet implies a collective behavior akin to conspiracy theories — suggesting a systemic and intentional pattern of violence by Israelis. This aligns with the IHRA's mention of conspiracy theories about Jews as a group.

3. **Double Standards and Exaggeration**: The language in the tweet suggests an exaggerated view of Israeli actions without parallel critique applied to similar situations involving other nations or groups. It implies a standard that is uniquely critical of Israel, which matches the IHRA’s point on applying double standards.

4. **Drawing Analogies with Nazi Behavior**: Although not explicitly stated, such allegations can evoke images of unjust collective blame and historical atrocities, implicitly drawing comparisons between Israeli actions and those of oppressive regimes like Nazi Germany, another example given by the IHRA.

Overall, the tweet uses rhetoric that fits within the patterns of demonization, dehumanization, and conspiratorial thinking identified in the IHRA definition. It portrays Israelis collectively as engaging in morally reprehensible behavior without basis, aligning it with antisemitic attitudes described by the IHRA.",No,"The tweet claims that an Israeli soldier shot an 8-year-old child, Malek Issa, after he bought a sandwich from a shop. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination or hostility against Jews as Jews, often involving harmful stereotypes or false attributions of collective blame.

The tweet does not mention Jews or Jewish institutions; rather, it criticizes an action purportedly taken by Israeli soldiers, which relates more to a critique of state actions than targeting Jews specifically. This aligns with guideline 13 under section C of the JDA, which states that evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state is not inherently antisemitic. This includes criticisms of its policies and practices.

The tweet does not utilize classical antisemitic symbols or stereotypes (guideline 2), nor does it hold Jews collectively responsible for actions taken by Israeli soldiers (guideline 7). It focuses on an action attributed to the state of Israel, rather than making generalizations about Jewish people.

The tweet in question accuses Israel's ""gunmen"" of harming Palestinians and then suggests a restriction on medical treatment based on national identity. This raises several points relevant to the IHRA definition:

1. **Targeting the State of Israel**: The tweet targets Israeli military forces (referred to as ""Israel's gunmen"") for their actions in Gaza, attributing harm to Palestinian individuals. According to the IHRA guidelines, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country is not inherently antisemitic. However, when such criticisms are framed using antisemitic tropes or double standards, they can become antisemitic.

2. **Double Standards**: The tweet implies a critique specific to Israel by suggesting that Israel deliberately forbids medical treatment for those it harmed. This could be interpreted as applying a double standard, wherein the expectation is set uniquely for Israel compared to other nations involved in conflicts, aligning with an IHRA example of antisemitism.

3. **Demonizing Allegations**: Although not overtly dehumanizing or demonizing Jews as individuals or as a collective, the tweet employs negative language toward Israeli forces that might be perceived as part of a broader pattern of hostile actions against Israel. This could contribute to an environment where Jews are stereotypically blamed for policies enacted by their government.

4. **Contextual Consideration**: The context in which this statement is made matters significantly. If part of a consistent narrative that unfairly singles out Israel using antisemitic tropes, such as portraying Israelis or the state in demonizing terms similar to historical stereotypes about Jews, it would reinforce an antisemitic perception.

In summary, while the tweet's primary focus is on Israeli military actions and policy, its framing could be seen as employing double standards specific to Israel, thus aligning with elements of the IHRA definition. Therefore, considering these aspects, the statement can be deemed antisemitic under this framework.",No,"The tweet describes specific actions attributed to ""Israel's gunmen"" and reports on the consequences faced by individuals in Gaza, including becoming amputees or paralysed. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), this type of statement does not inherently align with the definition of antisemitism.

1. **Focus on State Actions**: The tweet criticizes actions taken by the state of Israel and its military forces, rather than attributing negative characteristics or blame to Jews as a people or community. Criticism directed at a government's policies or practices is distinct from antisemitic statements that target Jewish individuals or institutions simply because they are Jewish.

2. **Contextual Analysis**: The JDA guidelines specify that criticism of Israel, when it pertains to the state itself and not to Jewish people globally, does not automatically equate to antisemitism (Guideline 13). This type of criticism falls under ""evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state,"" which includes its policies and actions.

3. **Absence of Antisemitic Themes**: The tweet lacks elements that are traditionally associated with antisemitism, such as portraying Jews or Jewish institutions as inherently linked to evil forces, engaging in conspiracy theories about global control, or using anti-Jewish stereotypes. There is no mention of Jewish people having collective responsibility for Israel's actions.

4. **No Collective Blame**: The tweet does not suggest that Jews collectively should be held responsible for the actions of the Israeli state (Guideline 7). It specifically mentions ""Israel's gunmen,"" separating these actions from Jewish individuals or communities as a whole.

In summary, while the content of the tweet is critical of Israel, it does not meet the criteria outlined in the JDA guidelines to be considered antisemitic. The critique focuses on governmental and military actions without implicating Jews as a group in any negative way.",1,0,1,0,0,0

They just want the right to hate Jews and are unhappy the council disagree with them. Expect trouble this evening. https://t.co/00sd3fxfJb,Yes,"The tweet in question appears to make several assertions that can be interpreted as aligning with the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. Firstly, it implies a collective political association by suggesting that ""anti-Israel Corbynites"" are uniformly against the definition of antisemitism, which could be perceived as an attempt to delegitimize criticism of Israel. The tweet insinuates that those who criticize or oppose the current definition do so out of a desire to ""hate Jews,"" employing a stereotype about motives that can fuel antisemitic sentiment.

Additionally, by stating that these individuals are ""unhappy"" with the council's disagreement and suggesting they ""just want the right to hate Jews,"" it implies an ulterior motive rooted in prejudice against Jewish people. This aligns with IHRA's example of attributing malevolent intent or conspiratorial actions to a group based on stereotypes.

The tweet also indirectly suggests that those opposing the definition are inherently antisemitic, which could contribute to a narrative where criticism is not tolerated unless it aligns with specific definitions and perspectives, potentially stifling legitimate discourse. This can foster an environment where Jews may be collectively held responsible for policies or actions associated with the state of Israel, another element noted in the IHRA examples.

Overall, by linking political opposition to a council's decision on defining antisemitism with the desire to ""hate Jews,"" the tweet indirectly employs stereotypes and demonizing language that can perpetuate antisemitic attitudes. Therefore, it could be considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze it against the provided definition and guidelines. 

1. **Antisemitism Definition**: The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). It emphasizes that such acts can manifest through words, visual images, or deeds.

2. **Guideline Analysis**:
   - **General Guidelines**: There is no evidence in the tweet of essentializing Jews as having inherent negative traits, nor does it attribute to them the idea of being linked to evil forces, which are key components highlighted in the guidelines for antisemitism.
   
   - **Israel and Palestine Context**: The tweet discusses criticism or opposition related to Israel (""anti-Israel Corbynites""). According to guideline 12, criticizing Zionism or supporting various constitutional arrangements for Jews and Palestinians is not inherently antisemitic. This suggests that expressing opposition to certain political positions regarding Israel does not automatically equate to antisemitism.

   - **Coded Language**: The tweet mentions ""the definition of #antisemitism"" and expresses disagreement with Corbynites about it. While the language implies tension or conflict over this topic, it doesn’t directly use coded speech that associates Jews with negative stereotypes or conspiracies.

3. **Contextual Considerations**:
   - The tweet references political figures (Corbyn) and a specific location (Tower Hamlets), indicating a local political dispute rather than an antisemitic attack.
   - It comments on the disagreement over definitions of antisemitism, which can be contentious but does not in itself constitute antisemitic behavior or speech as defined by JDA.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - While the tweet might express frustration or concern about political disagreements regarding antisemitism, it doesn't fulfill the criteria outlined by the JDA for being classified as antisemitic. There is no direct discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews simply because they are Jewish.
   
Thus, based on the analysis of the tweet through the lens of the JDA guidelines, it does not meet the threshold to be considered antisemitic according to that definition.",1,0,1,0,0,0

And we can’t have that.",Yes,"The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition because it implies that criticism or investigation of Israel is inherently problematic by suggesting it could lead to an unfavorable comparison with Canada's treatment of Indigenous people. This suggests a double standard, which is one of the examples listed in the IHRA working definition of antisemitism: ""Applying double standards by requiring of [Israel] a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.""

The tweet implies that it might be inappropriate to scrutinize Israel due to potential backlash, which can be seen as protecting Israel from criticism that is typically applied to other nations. By doing so, it indirectly suggests that such scrutiny should be avoided for reasons unrelated to the actual conduct being investigated—here, the hypothetical comparison to Canada's treatment of Indigenous peoples. This aligns with an antisemitic double standard where different criteria are unjustly applied to Israel.

Furthermore, while the tweet does not explicitly accuse Jews or Jewish people as a collective, it engages in rhetoric that can be perceived as minimizing potential issues within Israeli policy by comparing them to historically sensitive and controversial matters like Canada's treatment of Indigenous peoples. This approach may indirectly serve to delegitimize legitimate criticism of Israel by invoking unrelated historical grievances.

Therefore, the content and context of this tweet fall under antisemitic behavior as defined by the IHRA because it implies a protective stance against scrutiny towards Israel that is not similarly applied to other nations, which constitutes applying double standards.",No,"**

The tweet in question compares investigating Israel to Canada’s treatment of Indigenous people, suggesting a potential similarity between these situations. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), this statement does not inherently meet any criteria outlined for antisemitism.

1. **Context and Nature of Comparison**: The tweet is drawing an analogy between two distinct geopolitical or historical contexts: Israel's actions in relation to Palestinians and Canada’s treatment of Indigenous peoples. Such comparisons are common in political discourse and do not, on their own, constitute antisemitic speech as defined by the JDA.

2. **Absence of Antisemitic Elements**: The tweet does not include elements identified in the guidelines for antisemitism:
   - It does not make essentializing or sweeping negative generalizations about Jews (Guideline 1).
   - There is no linkage to Jews being associated with forces of evil, conspiracy theories, or any form of stereotypical imagery related to wealth, power, or other traditional antisemitic tropes (Guidelines 2 and 3).
   - The statement does not deny or minimize the Holocaust, nor does it involve coded language that implies Jewish control or responsibility for societal issues (Guideline 5).

3. **Israel-Palestine Context**: 
   - The tweet’s focus is on a critical perspective of Israel akin to the treatment of other states' actions in human rights contexts. It aligns with Guideline 13, which acknowledges evidence-based criticism of Israel as not inherently antisemitic.
   - While it compares Israel's situation to that of Canada and Indigenous peoples, this does not fall under guidelines concerning collective responsibility or denial of the right for Jewish existence (Guidelines 7 and 10), nor does it apply negative stereotypes specifically to the State of Israel in a way described in Guideline 6.

4. **Political Criticism**: The tweet falls within the realm of political speech, which is protected even if seen as contentious or reflecting a ""double standard"" (Guideline 15). This type of critique does not automatically translate into antisemitic intent or content.

In summary, the tweet appears to be an expression of political opinion through analogy and does not exhibit any characteristics defined by JDA as antisemitic. Thus, according to the guidelines provided, it is not considered antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

This can be seen as applying double standards to Israel by implying it should be held to different expectations regarding hate speech compared to other nations. According to the IHRA working definition, applying double standards by requiring of Israel behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation constitutes antisemitism.

Furthermore, the tweet uses a comparison with the Ku Klux Klan (Klan) and David Duke, which are historically associated with extreme racism and antisemitism. Such comparisons can evoke classic antisemitic tropes by indirectly suggesting that Israeli policies or rhetoric are akin to those of historically notorious hate groups known for their violent antisemitic activities.

Additionally, by dismissing the relevance of specific instances (""any one clip is irrelevant"") in evaluating Israel's role in ""hate speech,"" while simultaneously lumping it together with China and Russia, the tweet risks implying a collective responsibility or negative characterization of Israelis or the state itself. This aligns with the IHRA definition regarding holding Jews collectively responsible for actions related to the state of Israel.

Overall, the language and implications within the tweet can be interpreted as antisemitic based on the examples provided by the IHRA working definition, especially in terms of applying double standards and using historically loaded comparisons that evoke antisemitic stereotypes.",No,"The tweet in question compares Israel to other countries like China and Russia regarding accusations of ""hate speech."" According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitic behavior includes using classic stereotypes or symbols against Jews or Israel, holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel, or denying the right of Jewish people in Israel to exist. This tweet does not employ any traditional antisemitic tropes or symbols. It also does not hold all Jews globally accountable for the policies of the Israeli government.

The comparison appears to be a political statement critiquing multiple countries equally, suggesting that these nations are more culpable for hate speech than Israel without targeting Jewish people as a whole. As such, it aligns with guideline C13 from JDA, which acknowledges that evidence-based criticism of Israel or its policies is not inherently antisemitic. The tweet is framed in the context of discussing countries and their political behaviors rather than attributing negative characteristics to Jews as a group.

Therefore, while some might find this comparison contentious or disagreeable based on their views about Israeli politics, according to JDA's guidelines, it does not qualify as antisemitic.

While it addresses a political issue concerning Israel's potential annexation of territory in the West Bank, several aspects indicate an antisemitic underpinning:

1. **Double Standards**: The tweet accuses ""liberal zionists"" of hypocrisy for supporting both a liberal agenda and the state of Israel, suggesting that their support is insincere due to Israel's policies. This may imply a double standard by critiquing Israeli actions more harshly than similar actions by other countries.

2. **Negative Characterization**: By describing the core principle of Zionism as ""land theft,"" it employs negative stereotypes about Jewish people and Israeli citizens, potentially dehumanizing them by attributing inherently malicious intentions to their ideology and statehood.

3. **Collective Responsibility**: The tweet implies collective responsibility by attacking supporters of Israel (""liberal zionists"") alongside the actions of the state itself, suggesting a shared culpability that reflects one aspect of antisemitic rhetoric.

4. **Extremist Tone**: The dismissive and aggressive language (""don’t wanna hear SHIT from liberal zionists"") coupled with strong accusations contributes to an environment where Jews are demonized or dehumanized for political disagreements, aligning with the IHRA's examples of antisemitism in rhetoric.

While the tweet is ostensibly about a political issue, these elements collectively push it into the realm of antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. It combines negative stereotypes and potentially double standards specifically related to Jewish identity and Israeli state actions, thus meeting several criteria outlined in the IHRA's definition.",No,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish. The tweet in question criticizes a political action regarding Israel's potential annexation of parts of the West Bank and targets ""liberal zionists"" who support what the author perceives as land theft by the state.

1. **Target:** The criticism is directed at actions related to Israeli policy (specifically, its territorial ambitions) rather than Jews or Jewish individuals per se. The use of the term ""liberal zionists"" refers to a political stance on Zionism and does not inherently target Jewish people as such.

2. **Content:** The tweet does not employ antisemitic stereotypes or imagery; it instead focuses on political criticism of Israeli policy decisions. According to JDA guidelines, criticizing Israel's policies is not considered antisemitic (Guidelines 13-15).

3. **Context and Judgment:** Although the language used in the tweet (""i don’t wanna hear SHIT"") can be seen as harsh or confrontational, it does not constitute an attack on Jews based on their identity. The tweet remains within the bounds of political speech critiquing state actions, which is protected under JDA guidelines.

4. **Judaism vs. Zionism:** It’s important to distinguish between criticism of the Israeli state and its policies (Zionism) from antisemitic attacks against Jewish people globally. Criticizing Zionist ideology or Israeli policy does not automatically translate into antisemitism unless it involves harmful stereotypes about Jews as a group.

In summary, while the tweet may express strong opposition to certain political actions and ideologies associated with Israel, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the JDA guidelines because it doesn't attribute negative characteristics or intentions inherently to Jewish people.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Specifically, it describes Israel as ""ridiculous,"" ""antiquated,"" and based on ""lies about other people's land."" This kind of rhetoric can imply that the existence of Israel itself is illegitimate or unjustified, potentially denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination—a point explicitly mentioned in the IHRA definition as an example of antisemitism.

Furthermore, the tweet suggests that Seth Rogen has personal reservations about expressing these views publicly due to his connection with other Jews. This aspect could be seen as implying a stereotype about Jewish people having divided loyalties or pressures, which is also noted in the IHRA examples as potentially antisemitic behavior—specifically, it echoes the idea of holding Jewish individuals accountable for actions perceived to be associated with Israel.

While criticism of Israeli policies is not inherently antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, this tweet crosses into problematic territory by using language that may dehumanize or delegitimize the state of Israel as a whole and imply certain negative stereotypes about Jewish people. Thus, under the IHRA criteria, it can be considered antisemitic.",No,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). The tweet in question makes a political statement about Israel's legitimacy and existence but does not target Jews or Jewish individuals based on their identity. Here’s how it aligns with the JDA guidelines:

1. **General Criticism vs. Antisemitism:** The tweet criticizes the state of Israel, specifically commenting on its basis and claims regarding land, without attributing these views to all Jews as a group. This falls under guideline 13, which states that evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state is not antisemitic in itself.

2. **No Collective Blame or Hostility:** The tweet does not hold Jewish people collectively responsible for the actions or policies of Israel (guideline 7). It criticizes an individual's (Seth Rogen’s) reluctance to express his views, without implying hostility towards Jews as a group.

3. **No Essentializing or Negative Generalizations about Jews:** There are no sweeping negative generalizations made about Jewish people as a whole in the tweet. The criticism is directed at Israel and does not link Jews as a community with evil or conspiratorial motives (guideline 2).

4. **Absence of Antisemitic Symbols or Imagery:** The tweet lacks any symbols, images, or language that are stereotypically associated with antisemitism, such as conspiracy theories or grotesque caricatures (guidelines 3 and 6).

5. **Contextual Judgment:** While the context might be contentious, especially for those who view Israel in a different light, the tweet does not, on its face, meet the criteria of coded speech or hostility towards Jews themselves as per guidelines 4 and 15.

Therefore, based on the JDA definition and guidelines, this tweet is not antisemitic. It constitutes political expression regarding Israel without crossing into discrimination against Jewish people as a community.",1,0,1,0,0,0

According to the IHRA definition, while criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country is not inherently antisemitic, there are specific manifestations and contexts where such criticism can cross into antisemitism.

1. **Targeting Israel as a Jewish Collectivity**: The tweet refers to Israel as a ""pariah state,"" which can be seen as an example of applying double standards or holding Jews collectively responsible for actions attributed to the Israeli government. This aligns with IHRA's point that such criticisms should not be used to delegitimize the existence and right of self-determination of the State of Israel.

2. **Implying Collective Responsibility**: The tweet suggests a form of collective blame by implying that global inaction or leniency towards Israel is indicative of broader complicity or acceptance, indirectly invoking notions of Jewish power or influence that are often present in antisemitic rhetoric.

3. **Contextual Considerations**: While the tweet does not explicitly include other elements from the IHRA definition (such as Holocaust denial or conspiracies), its language and implication can contribute to an environment where Jews are collectively blamed for policies enacted by a state they do not uniformly control.

In summary, although the tweet might be framed as criticism of a country's policies, it crosses into antisemitism when considering the broader implications and context provided by the IHRA definition. It targets Israel in a manner that can contribute to or reflect antisemitic perceptions and stereotypes, particularly by suggesting collective Jewish responsibility and applying double standards.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is defined specifically as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews because they are Jewish or against Jewish institutions because they are Jewish. In this context, the tweet calling for Israel to be a ""pariah state"" does not directly reference Jews or Jewish people in general but focuses on criticism of the Israeli state itself.

The JDA guidelines acknowledge that it is not inherently antisemitic to criticize the State of Israel (Guideline 13). The statement calls for isolation of Israel due to its policies, which can be considered a form of political protest. This does not automatically equate to an attack on Jewish people as Jews but rather on the actions and policies of a state.

Moreover, while the JDA recognizes that certain forms of criticism may have antisemitic undertones or implications (e.g., when Israel is portrayed with symbols traditionally associated with antisemitism), there's no indication in this tweet of such imagery or language. The call for Israel to be a ""pariah"" does not by itself invoke stereotypes about Jews controlling governments, financial systems, etc., nor does it blame all Jewish people collectively.

However, context and additional content (like the linked material) could potentially reveal more nuances. If the criticism were presented alongside coded antisemitic language or imagery outside of this specific statement, a different evaluation might be necessary. In its current form, without further context suggesting hostility towards Jews as an ethnic or religious group, the tweet does not meet the JDA's definition of antisemitism.",1,0,1,0,0,0

The tweet in question suggests that ""Israel has never yet been held accountable by the int'l community for its war crimes — an investigation would be unprecedented #BDS."" This statement aligns with several aspects of the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, particularly when considering contemporary examples provided:

1. **Double Standards:** The tweet implies a demand for Israel to be held accountable in a manner not typically expected or demanded from other democratic nations. By suggesting that an investigation into Israeli actions would be unprecedented, it may imply that such scrutiny is uniquely applied to Israel and not comparable situations involving other countries.

2. **Denying the Right to Self-Determination:** The call for accountability framed in terms of ""war crimes"" can contribute to a narrative that questions or undermines the legitimacy of Israel's right to exist as a state. This aligns with denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, which is considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition.

3. **Criminalizing Legitimate Political Activity:** While the tweet itself does not call for violence or criminal activity, its alignment with the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement can be controversial. The BDS movement has been critiqued by some as being a platform that may foster antisemitic attitudes when it targets Israel uniquely and denies its right to exist.

4. **Historical Context:** The phrase ""war crimes"" is loaded with historical connotations, especially in the context of Jewish history and the Holocaust. This can evoke negative stereotypes and implications about collective guilt or responsibility, which are highlighted as antisemitic under the IHRA definition when used against Israel.

Given these points, the tweet demonstrates characteristics that align with patterns of antisemitism as outlined by the IHRA working definition, particularly through the application of double standards and questioning the legitimacy of the State of Israel.",No,"DECISION: No

EXPLICATION: 

The tweet in question states, ""Israel has never yet been held accountable by the int'l community for its war crimes — an investigation would be unprecedented #BDS."" To determine whether this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to evaluate it against the guidelines provided:

1. **Guideline 13** of the JDA clarifies that evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state, including its policies and practices, is not inherently antisemitic. This includes discussions about its actions in the West Bank and Gaza or its role in the region.

2. The tweet critiques Israel's accountability for alleged ""war crimes,"" suggesting an investigation should occur. This falls under political speech concerning the conduct of a state, which is explicitly covered as permissible criticism in Guideline 13.

3. **Guideline 14** states that boycotts, divestment, and sanctions are recognized forms of non-violent protest against states and are not antisemitic per se. The tweet includes the #BDS hashtag, which aligns with this guideline by implying support for a form of political activism rather than targeting Jews.

4. **Guideline 15** supports that even contentious or seemingly excessive criticism is protected under human rights instruments and does not automatically equate to antisemitism.

The tweet does not include any language or imagery associated with classical antisemitic stereotypes (as outlined in Guideline 2). It also does not hold Jews collectively responsible for the actions of Israel, a key aspect described as antisemitic in Guideline 7. The focus is on state-level accountability rather than attributing blame to Jewish people individually or collectively.

Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, the tweet is an expression of political criticism and advocacy without crossing into antisemitism. It adheres to accepted norms for debate about state actions and policies, particularly concerning Israel and Palestine.",1,0,1,0,0,0

No justice.\n\n#FreePalestine https://t.co/3CGpJsmU7L",Yes,"The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, particularly when analyzing certain aspects:

1. **Demonizing and Dehumanizing Allegations**: The tweet states that ""Israel sees Palestinian as subhuman,"" which is a dehumanizing accusation. Such rhetoric fits into the pattern of demonizing or dehumanizing Jews collectively by attributing negative characteristics to Israel, which is often perceived as a Jewish collectivity.

2. **Generalization and Stereotyping**: By asserting that Israel views Palestinians as ""subhuman"" without evidence, it relies on sweeping generalizations about Israelis (and by extension, Jews) that align with the IHRA's noted antisemitic stereotype of Jews or those linked to them acting in harmful ways towards others.

3. **Double Standards and Excessive Criticism**: The statement implies a moral failing unique to Israel (i.e., seeing Palestinians as subhuman), which could be interpreted as applying double standards by suggesting an expectation that is not applied to other nations facing similar conflicts. According to the IHRA, this can be an antisemitic manifestation when it involves holding Jews or Jewish entities to different standards than non-Jewish ones.

4. **Collective Responsibility**: The tweet indirectly holds Israelis (and by extension, Jews) collectively responsible for acts committed by individuals or the state apparatus of Israel without acknowledging the complexity and diversity within Israeli society itself.

While criticism of specific actions by the State of Israel is not inherently antisemitic according to IHRA, when such criticisms employ generalized dehumanizing language, rely on stereotypes, imply collective guilt, or apply double standards, they can cross into antisemitism. This tweet contains elements that align with those patterns, suggesting an underlying antisemitic tone in accordance with the IHRA definition.",No,"**

The tweet in question expresses grief over the death of Ahmed Erekat and criticizes Israel's treatment of Palestinians, framing it as viewing them as ""subhuman."" To determine if this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must analyze its content against specific guidelines provided:

1. **General Guidelines:**
   - The tweet does not engage in essentializing Jews or making sweeping negative generalizations about Jewish people.
   - It does not link Jews with forces of evil, nor does it suggest a conspiracy involving ""the Jews.""

2. **Guidelines B (Israel and Palestine):**
   - The tweet focuses on Israel's conduct towards Palestinians rather than applying symbols, images, or stereotypes traditionally associated with antisemitism to the State of Israel.
   - It does not hold Jewish individuals collectively responsible for Israel’s actions nor treat them as agents of Israel based solely on their identity.
   - There is no demand for Jews to publicly condemn Israel or Zionism.
   - The tweet does not suggest that non-Israeli Jews are more loyal to Israel than their countries of residence.
   - It does not deny the right of Israeli Jews to exist and flourish.

3. **Guidelines C (Israel and Palestine):**
   - Criticizing a state’s policies, including those related to its treatment of Palestinians, falls under ""evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state"" (guideline 13), which is explicitly not considered antisemitic by the JDA.
   - The tweet does not call for boycotts, divestment, or sanctions in itself, but even if it did, such actions are recognized as legitimate forms of protest that are not inherently antisemitic.

4. **Political Speech:**
   - The language used (""subhuman"") might be contentious and seen as excessive by some; however, the guidelines emphasize protecting speech under human rights instruments unless explicitly antisemitic (guideline 15).

In conclusion, while the tweet is critical of Israel's actions towards Palestinians and uses strong language, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as outlined in the JDA. It focuses on state behavior rather than making generalized negative claims about Jews or Jewish institutions, nor does it fit the specific examples of indirect or coded antisemitic speech described in the guidelines. Therefore, according to the JDA definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Here's how it aligns with aspects of the IHRA working definition:

1. **Stereotyping and Demonizing**: The tweet suggests that all Indian Muslims have a specific negative stance towards Israelis by stating they ""hate Israelis"" and therefore do not participate in an event described as ""all Hindustani Hindu."" This kind of generalization can be seen as demonizing or stereotyping, which aligns with the IHRA definition that mentions using stereotypes and negative character traits.

2. **Group Attribution**: By attributing a collective opinion (""hate Israel"") to all Indian Muslims, it implies they share uniform views based solely on their religious identity, thus echoing the IHRA's mention of making ""mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective."" Although this particular tweet is about a Muslim community, the mechanism is similar to how antisemitism operates when attributing negative characteristics collectively.

3. **Implications**: The tweet also indirectly supports narratives that could foster division and discrimination by implying exclusion based on religious identity rather than individual beliefs or actions. This aligns with the IHRA's concern over expressions of hatred towards specific groups, which may incite bias against them.

Overall, while the tweet targets Muslims in relation to Israel rather than Jews, it employs similar mechanisms of stereotyping and generalization that are central to antisemitic rhetoric as defined by the IHRA. This highlights how harmful rhetoric can operate across different contexts and target groups, potentially fostering an environment where discrimination is normalized.",No,"** 

To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to examine its content against the provided definition and guidelines.

1. **Definition of Antisemitism (JDA):**
   - The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish).

2. **Guidelines Analysis:**
   - **General Guidelines:** 
     - The tweet does not essentialize or make sweeping negative generalizations about the Jewish population. It specifically mentions Muslims in relation to Israel.
   
   - **Guideline 2** focuses on linking Jews with evil, such as conspiracy theories about Jewish control. The tweet makes a statement about Muslim sentiment towards Israelis and does not attribute any hidden power or evil intentions to Jews.

   - **Guidelines 3-5:** 
     - These guidelines discuss antisemitic expressions through words, images, deeds, coded speech, and Holocaust denial. The tweet does not include such content; it simply states a perception about Muslim attitudes toward Israelis without reference to Jewish people or institutions in an antisemitic context.

3. **Israel and Palestine Guidelines:**
   - **Guidelines 6-10:** 
     - These guidelines focus on applying negative stereotypes of Jews to Israel or holding all Jews accountable for the actions of Israel. The tweet does not apply such stereotypes to Jews but comments on Muslim attitudes toward Israelis.
   
   - **Guidelines 11-15:** 
     - These guidelines differentiate between antisemitic and non-antisemitic views regarding Israel and Palestine, allowing criticism of Israeli policies without it being inherently antisemitic. The tweet discusses perceptions about Muslims' stance towards Israel, not a critique or negative stereotype directed at Jews.

The content of the tweet does not express hostility against Jews as individuals or Jewish institutions; rather, it comments on Muslim perspectives toward Israelis. According to the JDA's guidelines, while some may find such statements contentious or reflective of bias, they do not meet the criteria for antisemitism under the provided definition and guidelines.

Therefore, based on the analysis above, the tweet is **not** considered antisemitic according to the JDA.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Here's a breakdown of relevant aspects:

1. **Double Standards**: The tweet suggests applying different criteria to Israel compared to other nations by supporting sanctions on Israel while opposing them for Iran. This aligns with point 7 of the IHRA definition, which refers to expecting behavior from Israel that is not expected of any other democratic nation.

2. **Implication and Context**: Although not explicitly stated in the tweet, comparing support against one ally (Israel) and opposition towards another state sponsor of terror (Iran) could imply an underlying bias against Jews or Israel. This context can resonate with how antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity by framing policies as threats.

3. **Collective Attribution**: By framing the stance on sanctions in terms of loyalty and national security, it may indirectly suggest that Jewish citizens (or those supportive of Israel) have conflicting loyalties. This can relate to point 6 of the IHRA definition, which involves accusing Jewish citizens of greater loyalty to Israel than their own countries.

While the tweet does not explicitly use antisemitic language or stereotypes, its implications and context within public discourse on Israel often play a role in perpetuating bias against Jews, fulfilling aspects of the IHRA definition. Therefore, according to the provided framework, it can be considered an expression of antisemitism.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must analyze it against the specific guidelines provided.

1. **Guidelines A**: The tweet does not contain discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. It focuses on political actions and policies rather than making negative generalizations about Jewish people. There is no indication of essentializing traits to Jews or linking them with evil forces (Guideline 2).

2. **Guidelines B**: The tweet does not apply classical antisemitic symbols, images, or stereotypes to Israel nor does it hold all Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the Israeli state (Guidelines 6 and 7). It critiques a political stance rather than attributing negative characteristics to Jewish people as a whole.

3. **Guidelines C**: The tweet falls under evidence-based criticism of Israel's policies, specifically its support or lack thereof for sanctions, which is not considered antisemitic according to the JDA (Guideline 13). Criticism that some might view as contentious does not automatically constitute antisemitism (Guideline 15).

The content of the tweet critiques a political stance taken by Ilhan Omar regarding sanctions on Iran and Israel. It argues from a national security perspective, contrasting the countries' geopolitical roles without making inherently negative or essentialist statements about Jewish people.

The tweet in question states, ""Bernie is the only one who acknowledges the racist, right-wing government in power in Israel."" This statement could potentially fall under several categories identified by the IHRA definition as examples of antisemitism:

1. **Applying Double Standards**: The use of terms like ""racist"" and ""right-wing"" can imply a negative characterization that may not be applied to other countries with similar political dynamics. If this language is part of a pattern of applying double standards specifically to Israel, it could be considered antisemitic.

2. **Using Classic Antisemitic Symbols**: While the tweet does not directly employ classic symbols associated with antisemitism (such as blood libel or claims about Jews killing Jesus), labeling an entire government as ""racist"" can evoke stereotypical accusations of inherent moral failing, which historically have been used against Jewish people.

3. **Denying Israel's Right to Self-Determination**: Labeling the Israeli government in such a definitive negative way could contribute to narratives that question Israel’s legitimacy or right to exist as a state, especially if it is done without acknowledging the complexities and nuances of international politics similar to those involving other nations.

While criticizing political leaders or governments is not inherently antisemitic, when such criticism employs generalized negative stereotypes or double standards specifically towards Jews or Israel, it can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition. The context in which the statement was made is also crucial; if it's part of a broader discourse that consistently singles out Israel with exaggerated negativity compared to other nations, it strengthens the argument for its classification as antisemitic.

Thus, while not all criticism of Israeli government policy automatically equates to antisemitism, this particular tweet could be interpreted as crossing into antisemitic territory due to its language and implications.",No,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet in question criticizes the Israeli government by describing it as ""racist"" and ""right-wing."" However, this criticism does not inherently target Jews as individuals or associate them with negative stereotypes linked to classical antisemitism.

The JDA guidelines specifically allow for evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state, including its policies and practices. It is explicitly stated that criticizing Israel's conduct or labeling it with terms such as ""racist"" is not automatically antisemitic unless these criticisms are used as a pretext for broader anti-Jewish prejudice or hostility (Guideline 13). The tweet does not attribute negative characteristics to Jews in general, nor does it employ classical antisemitic symbols, stereotypes, or imply that Jewish people collectively control the Israeli government.

Furthermore, political speech that might be seen as contentious or excessive is protected under human rights instruments and is not automatically classified as antisemitic (Guideline 15). The tweet focuses on a political critique of Israel's government, which falls within permissible expressions of opinion about state policies rather than an expression of hostility toward Jews as a people.

According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, several key points need to be considered to determine if this statement could be classified as antisemitic:

1. **Targeting Jewish Individuals/Leaders**: The tweet directly references Benjamin Netanyahu, who is Jewish, in connection with negative descriptors (""messianic,"" ""racist,"" and ""nationalist""). When such terms are used specifically to criticize a Jewish leader or community leader, it may imply stereotypes associated with Jewish individuals or leadership.

2. **Negative Stereotypes**: Describing the period under Netanyahu as ""messianic"" can invoke negative stereotypical notions that associate Jews with extreme religious fervor. This plays into harmful clichés that have historically been used to marginalize Jewish people by painting them in a monolithic and exaggerated light regarding their religious beliefs.

3. **Charges of Racism**: By labeling the decade as ""racist,"" it might imply that Netanyahu, or Israeli policies under his leadership, are racially prejudiced. This could unfairly associate these accusations with Jewish individuals or Israel as a collective entity without similar criticism directed toward non-Jewish leaders or countries, thus potentially aligning with the IHRA examples of applying double standards.

4. **Nationalism**: Describing it as ""nationalist"" can be seen in different lights depending on context; however, when combined with terms like ""messianic"" and ""racist,"" it could contribute to a portrayal that stereotypes Jewish or Israeli nationalism in a negative way.

5. **Contextual Considerations**: Although criticism of political leaders or states is not inherently antisemitic, the manner in which such criticisms are framed can cross into antisemitism if they employ harmful stereotypes or double standards as outlined by the IHRA definition.

Given these points, the language used in the tweet can be interpreted as employing negative stereotypes and possibly attributing undesirable characteristics to a Jewish leader and his policies. This aligns with several examples provided under the IHRA's framework for what could be considered antisemitic, particularly when considering the broader context of how Jews or Israel are being depicted. Thus, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet can reasonably be classified as antisemitic.",No,"** 

The tweet in question states: ""Israel election results: Netanyahu reaps the fruits of a messianic, racist and nationalist decade."" To determine if this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to evaluate it against the guidelines provided.

1. **General Guidelines:** 
   - The tweet criticizes specific political outcomes and ideologies in Israel rather than making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews as a people or attributing inherent characteristics to them.
   
2. **Guideline 2 on Classic Antisemitism:**
   - There is no indication that the tweet links Jewish identity with evil, conspiracy, or hidden power structures beyond critiquing political actions within Israel.

3. **Manifestation of Antisemitism (Guidelines 3):** 
   - The language used does not target Jews as individuals or a people but critiques political figures and ideologies. It mentions ""Netanyahu"" specifically rather than all Jewish people or institutions.
   
4. **Direct vs. Indirect/Coded Speech (Guideline 4):**
   - While the words ""racist"" and ""nationalist"" are strong, they are used in a specific context referring to political actions attributed to Netanyahu's administration. This does not inherently code for antisemitic meanings unless further contextual evidence indicates otherwise.
   
5. **Denial or Minimization of the Holocaust (Guideline 5):** 
   - The tweet makes no reference to denying or minimizing historical events like the Holocaust.

6. **Israel and Palestine Guidelines:**
   - Guideline 6 involves applying negative stereotypes traditionally associated with Jews to Israel, which is not directly evident here.
   - There's no collective blaming of all Jews for political actions (Guideline 7).
   - No demands are made on individual Jews to take a position against their will or identity concerning Zionism or Israeli politics (Guideline 8).
   - The tweet does not assume loyalty or make assumptions about non-Israeli Jews' political allegiances (Guideline 9).

Considering these aspects, the content of the tweet focuses specifically on criticizing political ideologies and actions within Israel rather than targeting Jewish people as a whole. As such, based on the JDA's definitions and guidelines, this tweet is not inherently antisemitic.

1. **Demonization and Dehumanizing Allegations**: The language used in the tweet accuses Israel of lying and implies malicious intent behind its military actions, suggesting a sinister agenda without evidence. This fits into the category of demonizing or dehumanizing allegations about Jews, specifically linking these characteristics to Israeli policies.

2. **Applying Double Standards**: The tweet suggests that Israel is uniquely propagandistic (""Israeli propaganda machine"") and criticizes mainstream media for uncritically accepting Israel’s narrative (""worse still the MSM sucks it up""). This implies a double standard in how Israel is judged compared to other nations, which aligns with the IHRA definition concerning applying double standards to Israel.

3. **Accusations of Harm towards Civilians**: By focusing on alleged civilian casualties and framing Israeli military actions as targeting civilians, the tweet fits into the narrative of attributing harm or negative intentions specifically to Jews (in this case, Israelis). This can be seen as a form of blaming or demonizing which is directed at Jewish individuals or collectives.

Overall, while criticism of specific policies or actions by any country, including Israel, is not inherently antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, the way in which these criticisms are framed here—using demonization, suggesting deceit and malicious intent, and applying double standards—crosses into antisemitic territory.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet in question criticizes Israel's military actions by suggesting that bombs are being dropped on civilian targets rather than strictly military ones. It does not explicitly target Jews or Jewish people as a group but instead focuses on the policies of the Israeli state.

The tweet may fall under guideline B.8, which states that it is antisemitic to require individuals to condemn Israel or Zionism because they are Jewish. However, this guideline typically applies when there is an implication that all Jews should individually bear responsibility for actions taken by Israel as a state, which does not seem evident in the content of the tweet.

The language used in the tweet might be seen as contentious or hyperbolic but does not include antisemitic stereotypes, imagery, or claims about Jewish people as defined under guidelines A.2 and A.3. The criticism is directed towards a political entity (the State of Israel) rather than Jews collectively, which aligns with guideline B.13 that recognizes the legitimacy of evidence-based criticisms of Israeli policies without them being inherently antisemitic.

Furthermore, according to guideline 14, actions such as boycott, divestment, and sanctions—or criticism thereof—are not automatically deemed antisemitic if they are focused on political or state behaviors rather than targeting Jews collectively. The tweet does not advocate for any of these specific measures but criticizes what it perceives as misinformation about military actions.

Finally, guideline 15 emphasizes the protection of political speech under human rights instruments even when it is contentious or seen as applying a double standard, which applies to this case. Criticism alone, without evidence of targeting Jews as a collective group due to their ethnicity or religion, does not meet the definition of antisemitism according to the JDA guidelines.

In conclusion, while the tweet contains strong criticism of Israeli military policy and implies that media representations are biased, it does not by itself contain elements that would classify it as antisemitic under the JDA definition.

The key phrase ""LAW INTENDED FOR ISRAEL"" alongside the reference to Mosaic Law suggests an application of religious law specifically to the state of Israel, which could be seen as applying double standards—critiquing Israel for being held to different expectations than other countries. This aligns with one of the examples provided by the IHRA definition: ""Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.""

Furthermore, interpreting religious texts in such a way that singles out modern political entities like Israel may imply that contemporary Jewish individuals and communities are primarily defined by their religious obligations to ancient laws. This could be perceived as dehumanizing or stereotyping Jews by reducing their identity to those terms, which is another aspect of antisemitism according to the IHRA definition.

1. **Content of the Tweet:** The tweet references a biblical text, specifically Malachi 4:4 from the English Standard Version, which mentions the law given by Moses at Horeb for all Israel. It does not contain any direct statements or implications that express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions.

2. **Application of Guidelines:** 
   - The tweet does not engage in essentializing characteristics of Jews nor make sweeping negative generalizations about them (Guideline 1).
   - There is no mention or implication linking Jews to forces of evil or conspiracy theories (Guideline 2). It refers to a religious text, which by itself isn't inherently antisemitic.
   - The tweet does not manifest antisemitism through words, visual images, or deeds as described in Guideline 3. It neither insults nor portrays Jews negatively nor involves any harmful actions against them.
   - There is no evidence of coded language that suggests antisemitic ideas (Guideline 4). The reference to a biblical passage does not inherently carry antisemitic connotations without additional context or interpretation indicating such.
   - The tweet does not deny, minimize, or distort the Holocaust in any way (Guideline 5).

3. **Context of Israel and Palestine:** 
   - The tweet does not apply negative stereotypes or symbols of classical antisemitism to Israel (Guideline 6) nor holds Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct (Guideline 7). It neither requires Jewish individuals to condemn Israel or Zionism (Guideline 8) nor assumes their loyalty based on religious identity (Guideline 9).
   - The tweet does not deny the right of Jews in Israel to exist and flourish (Guideline 10).

Given this analysis, the tweet does not meet any of the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It simply cites a biblical verse without expressing any form of prejudice or hostility towards Jews or Jewish institutions.

According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, one manifestation of antisemitism involves denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination. This can include claims that the existence of a State of Israel as a Jewish state is illegitimate or racist.

The tweet's implication that maintaining Israel as a ""Jewish state"" should be sacrificed for full equality under a different political structure challenges the legitimacy of Israel’s right to self-determination as a Jewish nation. It suggests that Israel’s identity as a Jewish state could and perhaps should be replaced by another form of governance, which aligns with the IHRA definition's point about denying this right.

Furthermore, while advocating for democracy or equality is not inherently antisemitic, in the context of the tweet, it implies a denial of Israel’s right to exist as a nation that prioritizes its Jewish identity. This can be perceived as applying a double standard by expecting different behavior from Israel than from other democratic nations, another point highlighted under the IHRA definition.

Therefore, based on the content and implications of the tweet in relation to the IHRA's working definition of antisemitism, it can be considered antisemitic because it potentially denies the Jewish people their right to self-determination by questioning or undermining Israel’s status as a Jewish state.",No,"**

The tweet suggests that if the two-state solution is deemed impossible, some Americans would favor a democratic state over maintaining Jewish identity in Israel, with an emphasis on full equality for all inhabitants. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), such a statement is not inherently antisemitic for several reasons:

1. **Context of Political Opinion:** The tweet discusses a political viewpoint about potential future governance models for Israel and Palestine. It aligns with guideline 12, which states that criticizing or opposing Zionism as a form of nationalism, or supporting constitutional arrangements that ensure full equality in the region (such as one democratic state), is not inherently antisemitic.

2. **Focus on Equality:** The emphasis on ""full equality"" reflects a political stance advocating for equal rights and opportunities rather than targeting Jews as a group negatively. This consideration aligns with guidelines addressing evidence-based criticism of Israel's policies without attributing negative characteristics to all Jewish people, thereby distinguishing between legitimate political critique and antisemitism.

3. **Absence of Negative Stereotypes or Hostility:** The tweet does not employ the symbols, images, or stereotypes associated with classical antisemitism as noted in guideline 6, nor does it hold Jews collectively responsible for political developments related to Israel (guideline 7).

4. **Discussion on Governance Models:** It discusses a potential shift toward a democratic framework without implying any inherent negative qualities of Jewish people or suggesting they are responsible for undesirable outcomes.

5. **Protections under Free Speech Principles:** According to guideline 15, even contentious political opinions are protected speech and do not automatically equate to antisemitism. The tweet presents an opinion about possible future governance that falls within these protections without invoking harmful stereotypes or accusations against Jewish people as a whole.

1239355871349608448,SiegelJules,2020-03-16 01:00:40+00:00,0,Israel,SPOT THE DIFFERENCE:\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu enforces a 14-day quarantine for all new arrivals to Israel; leftists shout “racist”.\n\nJacinda Ardern announces the exact same thing for New Zealand; leftists praise her as a “hero”.\n\nExcuse my confusion.,Yes,"**DECISION:** Yes

**EXPLICATION:**

The tweet appears to be antisemitic according to the IHRA definition of antisemitism for several reasons:

1. **Double Standards and Comparison with Negative Stereotypes**: The tweet explicitly highlights a perceived double standard in public reactions to similar actions taken by Benjamin Netanyahu and Jacinda Ardern, focusing on labeling Netanyahu's quarantine measure as ""racist"" while praising Ardern's identical action as heroic. This suggests the application of a double standard based solely on their identities, which aligns with one of the manifestations listed in the IHRA definition: applying different criteria to Israel or Jewish people than to others.

2. **Negative Implication and Stereotyping**: The tweet implies that criticism directed towards Netanyahu is unfounded by juxtaposing it with praise for Ardern, indirectly suggesting that only because Netanyahu is a Jew (or perceived as such) are his actions criticized more harshly. This could play into antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish leaders being unfairly targeted or viewed negatively compared to non-Jewish leaders.

3. **Context of Public Life and Media**: The tweet's content involves public life discourse, specifically media portrayal and reaction to political figures' decisions during a global crisis, reflecting how such narratives can contribute to societal biases against Jews by implying that their actions are unjustly scrutinized or criticized.

While the tweet does not explicitly use classical antisemitic symbols or rhetoric, its implication of double standards in criticism based on identity aligns with IHRA's examples of antisemitism. It reflects a narrative that could perpetuate negative stereotypes and bias against Jewish leaders by suggesting they face unfair treatment compared to non-Jewish counterparts for similar actions.",No,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). The tweet contrasts the reactions of two political leaders—Benjamin Netanyahu and Jacinda Ardern—to similar public health measures (14-day quarantine) by highlighting different responses from ""leftists.""

1. **Direct vs. Indirect/Explicit vs. Coded Antisemitism:** 
   - The tweet does not explicitly use antisemitic language or symbols. It comments on perceived inconsistencies in reactions to the same policy enacted by two different leaders.
   
2. **Criticism of Israel and Zionism:**
   - The tweet's mention of Benjamin Netanyahu, an Israeli politician, could superficially raise concerns about being coded criticism of Israel. However, it does not directly apply negative stereotypes or symbols associated with classic antisemitism to Netanyahu or the State of Israel itself (guidelines 6-10).

3. **Context and Judgement:**
   - The tweet is framed as a commentary on differing responses to identical policies rather than an attack on Jewish people or institutions. It does not imply that Jews possess inherent negative traits, nor does it suggest that Netanyahu's policy is inherently evil or part of a larger conspiracy.
   
4. **General Criticism vs. Antisemitism:**
   - The tweet can be interpreted as expressing frustration with perceived double standards in political discourse rather than an expression of antisemitic sentiment. According to the JDA, criticism of Israel's policies, actions, or leaders (such as Netanyahu) is not inherently antisemitic unless it involves classic antisemitic tropes or collective blame.

In conclusion, while the tweet may reflect a critique that some could interpret as biased against Netanyahu due to his identity as an Israeli leader and Jew, it does not meet the JDA's criteria for antisemitism based on its content and framing. Therefore, according to the JDA definition, this tweet is not antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Here’s why:

1. **Targeting Israel as a Jewish collectivity**: The tweet implies a conflict or competition using national symbols (i.e., countries' names) where ""Israel"" is placed on one side of the fight, potentially aligning it with Jewish identity in this context.

2. **Use of violent imagery and stereotypes**: By framing this interaction as a ""fight,"" especially in a metaphorical sense linked to an event like UFC (a combat sports organization), the tweet employs violent imagery that could be seen as hostile or aggressive towards Israel. This can evoke negative stereotypes associated with conflict, which may resonate with antisemitic perceptions.

3. **Potential for demonization**: The format of the statement suggests a direct and adversarial engagement between ""Israel"" and another entity. Such framing may reinforce an us-versus-them mentality that could be used to demonize or dehumanize Israel as a representation of Jewish people, aligning with examples in the IHRA definition where Israel is unjustly portrayed negatively.

While this interpretation depends heavily on context and intent (e.g., whether it's part of a sports rivalry discussion), without additional clarifying information, there are enough elements that could be perceived as antisemitic based on the provided definition. It’s important to consider the broader context in which such statements are made to fully assess their implications.",No,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet in question mentions a fight between Israel and Costa at an event called UFC 253, followed by support for Nigeria (""Naijaaaaaa 🇳🇬 all the way 🍿""). There are several reasons why this tweet does not fall under antisemitism as defined by JDA:

1. **Lack of Hostility or Prejudice:** The tweet merely references a sports event and expresses support for one participant over another. It does not display any hostility, prejudice, or negative stereotypes specifically directed at Jews or Jewish institutions.

2. **Contextual Relevance:** The reference to Israel in this context is likely in relation to the nationality of the fighter (Israel Adesanya) participating in the UFC event, rather than being an expression related to the state of Israel or its policies. This context does not align with any antisemitic indicators outlined in JDA.

3. **Absence of Antisemitic Content:** The tweet does not use symbols, images, language, or actions that are associated with classical antisemitism (as described in guidelines 2 and 3) nor does it apply negative stereotypes to Jews or Israel as a collective representation of Jews.

4. **Non-Hateful Intentions:** There is no indication of intent to discriminate against or harm Jewish people based on their identity. The tweet's content appears to be about sports fandom rather than an expression of antisemitic views.

In conclusion, while the tweet involves Israel, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to JDA because it lacks any form of prejudice, hostility, discrimination, or violence against Jews as individuals or Jewish institutions.",1,0,1,0,0,0

While it does not explicitly mention Jews or Judaism, its context and potential implications should be examined under the IHRA definition of antisemitism.

1. **Contextual Implications**: Gal Gadot is a well-known Israeli actress and public figure who has been an active participant in pro-Israel initiatives. Criticizing her role as an ambassador implies dissatisfaction with Israel's representation by prominent Jewish figures, potentially reflecting underlying negative stereotypes or sentiments directed towards Jews more broadly.

2. **Double Standards and Collective Responsibility**: The tweet could be interpreted as applying double standards to Israel (a state often associated with its Jewish population), suggesting that it does not deserve a particular Jewish figure as an ambassador. This aligns with the IHRA's example of ""applying double standards by requiring of it [Israel] a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation."" It also hints at holding Jews collectively responsible for actions related to Israel, which is mentioned in the IHRA definition.

3. **Potential Stereotyping and Demonization**: Although the tweet does not directly demonize or stereotype Jewish people, its dismissive tone towards a prominent Jewish individual could contribute to an environment that perpetuates negative perceptions of Jews, especially when tied to their association with Israel.

Given these considerations, the tweet can be seen as potentially antisemitic under the IHRA definition because it implies dissatisfaction with and criticism of an Israeli-Jewish figure in a way that might indirectly target or reflect negatively on Jewish people.",No,"The tweet ""Gal Gadot is the U.S. ambassador Israel doesn’t deserve"" does not, on its face, appear to meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Here's a breakdown according to the JDA guidelines:

1. **Essentialization or Negative Generalizations**: The tweet does not essentialize Jews or make sweeping negative generalizations about them as a group.

2. **Linkage to Evil or Conspiracy**: There is no suggestion that Jews are linked with forces of evil, nor is there any implication of Jewish conspiracy in the content of the tweet.

3. **Manifestation in Words, Images, and Deeds**: The tweet does not contain antisemitic words, images, or actions such as accusing all Jews of being wealthy, stingy, unpatriotic, or depicting them negatively. It refers to an individual (Gal Gadot) and her role without attaching negative stereotypes to the Jewish community.

4. **Direct or Coded Language**: The tweet does not use coded language suggesting Jewish control over global entities like governments or banks. It is a critique of an individual's suitability for a diplomatic position, which is not inherently linked to antisemitic themes.

5. **Denial of Holocaust**: There is no reference to the Holocaust or any form of denial or minimization of it in the tweet.

6-10. **Israel and Palestine Context**: The tweet does not apply negative stereotypes of classical antisemitism to Israel, hold Jews collectively responsible for its actions, require Jews to publicly condemn Israel, assume greater loyalty from non-Israeli Jews, nor deny the right of Jews to exist and flourish in Israel. It critiques a political figure's suitability rather than addressing these specific concerns.

11-15. **Non-Antisemitic Critiques**: The tweet could be seen as part of legitimate criticism or debate regarding Israeli politics or representation, which is not inherently antisemitic per the JDA guidelines if it doesn't rely on antisemitic tropes.

In conclusion, while the tweet expresses a critical opinion about an individual's role in representing Israel, it does not align with the characteristics outlined by the JDA for what constitutes antisemitism. It remains important to consider context and intent, as the line between criticism of Israeli policies or figures and antisemitism can sometimes be nuanced. However, based solely on the content provided, this tweet does not appear antisemitic according to the JDA definition.",1,0,1,0,0,0

This statement can be interpreted through various lenses of the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Here are key aspects to consider:

1. **Applying Double Standards**: The tweet suggests that only Israel's actions draw attention or criticism (""the world goes blind""), implying a bias in how its actions are perceived compared to other countries. This can be seen as applying double standards, which is listed in the IHRA examples of antisemitism.

2. **Comparison with Nazi Practices**: Although not directly stated, suggesting that only Israel's actions are ignored by the international community could implicitly draw comparisons between Israel and historical entities like Nazi Germany, particularly if the criticism implies a systemic lack of accountability or disproportionate scrutiny on Israel alone.

3. **Collective Responsibility**: By focusing exclusively on the state of Israel without acknowledging individual actions within other nations or groups, it may imply collective responsibility—another antisemitic trope identified by IHRA.

4. **Context and Intent**: While criticism of any country's policies is legitimate, according to IHRA guidelines, if such criticisms are used in a manner that aligns with the patterns of discrimination or demonization outlined above, they can cross into antisemitism. 

Overall, while not explicitly antisemitic on its face, this tweet could be considered antisemitic when analyzed within the context of the IHRA definition due to the implications of double standards and potential misuse of collective blame.",No,"** 

The tweet in question states: ""@JimBowey1 @yosefyisrael25 @DemopJ @nytimes But when Israel commits terror, the world goes blind!"" To determine whether this statement is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze it against the provided guidelines.

1. **General Guidelines:**
   - The tweet does not involve essentializing Jews or making sweeping negative generalizations about them as a group.
   - It does not link Jews with evil, nor does it suggest that ""the Jews"" are behind any nefarious activity in terms of control over governments, media, etc.

2. **Specific Guidelines on Israel:**
   - The tweet criticizes the actions of the state of Israel but does not apply symbols, images, or stereotypes of classical antisemitism to Israel (Guideline 6).
   - It does not hold all Jews collectively responsible for the conduct of the Israeli government (Guideline 7) nor does it treat individual Jews as agents of Israel's policies.
   - The tweet does not require Jews to publicly condemn Israel or Zionism, nor does it assume that non-Israeli Jews are more loyal to Israel than their own countries (Guidelines 8 and 9).
   - It does not deny the right of Jews in Israel to exist and flourish as a collective or individual group (Guideline 10).

3. **Non-Antisemitic Criticism:**
   - According to Guideline 13, evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state is not inherently antisemitic. The tweet criticizes actions taken by the Israeli government, suggesting that these actions are perceived as ""terror"" and expressing frustration over international responses.
   - This type of criticism falls under political speech aimed at holding a state accountable for its policies or actions, which is explicitly covered in Guidelines 12 and 13.

4. **Political Speech:**
   - Guideline 15 emphasizes that even if some may view certain criticisms as excessive or contentious, they are protected forms of expression and not automatically antisemitic unless they meet specific criteria outlined elsewhere in the guidelines.

Given these considerations, while the tweet expresses a strong opinion regarding Israel's actions and international reactions to them, it does not cross into antisemitism according to the JDA definition. It remains within the bounds of permissible political criticism of state policies and practices without attributing those policies or actions to Jews as an ethnic group or linking them with harmful stereotypes.",1,0,1,0,0,0

1. **Conflating Criticism of Israel with Antisemitism**: While criticism of Israel is not inherently antisemitic, when such criticism uses demonizing rhetoric or implies a collective blame for Jews globally, it can cross into antisemitism. The tweet's use of terms like ""#israelicrimesagainsthumanity"" and the notion that ""if it didn't [BDS] work, Israel wouldn’t care"" suggests a portrayal of Israel in extremely negative terms without acknowledging its right to self-defense or existence. This type of rhetoric often aligns with demonizing stereotypes.

2. **Implication of Global Jewish Influence**: The tweet implies that there is a uniform and significant influence by Jews worldwide (through the mention of “#BDS” as a tool against Israeli policies), which can be interpreted through the antisemitic lens of suggesting a monolithic Jewish power influencing global affairs, particularly in relation to Israel.

3. **Use of BDS**: While the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement itself is not inherently antisemitic, it has been argued that when used in ways that deny the legitimacy of Israel as a state or draw parallels between Israeli policies and those of Nazi Germany, it can be seen as antisemitic. The tweet implies a strong stance against Israel's actions without acknowledging its right to exist or its security concerns, which is similar to denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination.

4. **Collective Blame**: By suggesting that BDS is necessary due to ""our own government"" supporting Israeli policies labeled as crimes, it can imply collective responsibility and blame on Jews for actions taken by the state of Israel. This aligns with the antisemitic idea of holding all Jews accountable for the actions of any Jewish person or group.

Given these points, the tweet crosses into antisemitism according to the IHRA definition because it employs rhetoric that demonizes Israel as a collective entity, suggests global Jewish influence and control over government policies concerning Israel, and potentially engages in blaming Jews for Israeli state actions.",No,"**

The tweet in question advocates for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel due to allegations of ""crimes against humanity"" by the Israeli government. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), a critique of Israel's policies or actions is not inherently antisemitic if it falls within certain guidelines. 

1. **Guideline 13** from section C specifically states that evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state, including its institutions and policies, both domestic and international, is not antisemitic in itself. The tweet aligns with this guideline by attributing the call to #BDS to governmental actions rather than targeting Jewish people or institutions based on inherent characteristics.

2. **Guideline 14** acknowledges that boycotts, divestments, and sanctions are non-violent forms of political protest against states and are not inherently antisemitic. The tweet's reference to BDS is consistent with this guideline as it frames the movement as a nonviolent tool against state actions.

3. There is no indication in the tweet that employs stereotypical or essentialized portrayals of Jews, nor does it engage in coded language suggesting Jewish control over global institutions or attributing evil characteristics specifically to Jewish people (as noted in guidelines 2 and 4).

Given these points, the content of the tweet focuses on political actions taken by a state rather than targeting Jews as Jews. Therefore, based on the JDA's criteria, this tweet does not meet the definition of antisemitism.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Specifically, it suggests that a nurse from Israel would be subject to extreme punishment (a fine of a million dollars) under ""Cuomo's America,"" implying a double standard when compared to similar actions by non-Jews or in other contexts. This implies a bias against Jews and/or the state of Israel.

The tweet indirectly attributes negative stereotypes or unfair treatment to Jewish individuals simply because they are associated with Israel, which aligns with several points in the IHRA definition:

1. **Applying Double Standards**: The tweet suggests that different behavior is expected from Israeli individuals compared to others, implying a bias against Jews based on their nationality.

2. **Using Symbols and Images Associated with Classic Antisemitism**: While not directly invoking classic antisemitic symbols like blood libel, the implication of disproportionate punishment can be seen as using modern stereotypes about Israel and its citizens for negative characterization.

3. **Targeting the State of Israel in a Negative Manner**: By focusing on an Israeli individual's actions and suggesting they would receive undue penalties compared to others in similar situations, it contributes to negative perceptions of Israelis and by extension, Jews.

Thus, despite not explicitly mentioning Jews or using classic antisemitic imagery, the tweet leverages stereotypes about Jewish people through its portrayal of Israelis, fitting within certain aspects of the IHRA's definition. Therefore, according to the criteria provided, the tweet can be considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question describes an incident involving a nurse in Israel who grabbed a pizza delivery person to administer a vaccine before it expired. The tweet compares this situation to hypothetical regulatory actions that might occur ""in Cuomo's America,"" referencing the former Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo.

To evaluate whether this tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must consider if it meets any criteria outlined in the guidelines:

1. **General Hostility or Prejudice Against Jews**: The tweet does not display discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as a group or Jewish institutions.

2. **Linking Jews to Evil**: There is no indication that Jews are being associated with evil, conspiracy, or negative stereotypes inherent in classical antisemitism (Guideline 2).

3. **Words, Images, and Deeds**: The tweet neither uses derogatory language about Jews nor depicts them in a stereotypical manner as outlined in Guideline 3.

4. **Direct or Indirect Antisemitic Content**: There is no coded message suggesting that ""the Jews"" possess undue power or control, nor does it racialize or stigmatize Jews (Guidelines 4).

5. **Holocaust Denial**: The tweet makes no reference to the Holocaust or any attempt to deny its occurrence.

6-10. **Israel and Palestine-Specific Antisemitism**: The content of the tweet does not apply classical antisemitic symbols, stereotypes, or images to Israel (Guidelines 6-10). It also doesn’t imply collective responsibility for actions of the Israeli state nor denies the right of Jews in Israel to exist.

11-15. **Non-Antisemitic Criticism**: The tweet could be seen as partaking in a broader discussion about regulatory actions in different contexts, which falls under permissible criticism (Guidelines 13-14). It does not single out Jewish people or Israelis for criticism based on their identity but rather comments on an isolated incident.

Overall, while the tweet discusses an event in Israel and makes a comparative comment, it does not meet any of the criteria set forth by the JDA to be considered antisemitic. The focus is on a specific act without broader implications related to Jewish people or stereotypes about them.",1,0,1,0,0,0

This scenario involves several elements from the IHRA working definition of antisemitism:

1. **Using Symbols or Images Associated with Classic Antisemitism**: By naming a criminal territory ""The Complexo de Israel,"" there is a symbolic association between Jews (or, more broadly, anything related to Israel) and negative actions such as drug dealing and suppression of religious practices. This can be seen as employing the symbols associated with classic antisemitic imagery in a derogatory manner.

2. **Denying Rights or Practices**: The reference to banning Afro-Brazilian religions within these territories could imply an effort to suppress cultural or religious expression, which echoes historical patterns where Jewish communities have been targeted for their distinct practices and beliefs. Although the primary victims here are practitioners of Afro-Brazilian religions, the antisemitic dimension arises from linking this suppression with Israel.

3. **Double Standards**: The context suggests that control by evangelical drug dealers over these territories involves applying a religious or ethnic double standard, similar to how Jews have historically been targeted for their cultural and religious distinctiveness.

Therefore, while the tweet does not directly target Jewish individuals or communities, it uses the name ""Israel"" in a way that associates negative criminal activities with Jewish identity. This falls within antisemitic patterns of using Israel as a symbol to convey hatred or malign intent, thereby meeting the IHRA definition's criteria for contemporary manifestations of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question mentions ""The 'Complexo de Israel'"" in the context of criminal activity and territorial control by evangelical drug dealers and paramilitaries. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. 

In this tweet, ""The 'Complexo de Israel'"" does not inherently carry an antisemitic meaning. It appears to be a name used by criminals for one of their territories and is mentioned alongside other criminal activities like banning Afro-Brazilian religions. There are no indications in the text that suggest linking Jews or Jewish institutions to evil forces, making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews, or employing classic anti-Jewish stereotypes as outlined in the JDA guidelines.

The tweet does not involve any direct or indirect hostility towards Jews or Jewish institutions. It lacks coded language or expressions that would align with antisemitic rhetoric according to the JDA's definition and guidelines. Instead, it refers to a local context where ""Israel"" is used as part of a name in a criminal setting, which does not equate to an attack on Judaism or Jewish people.

This indicates an awareness and consideration of these connections when evaluating the product, which could imply a bias based on national or ethnic origins.

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes making decisions or judgments based on stereotypes or perceptions associated with Jews as a collective group. Specifically, it mentions:

- Applying double standards by requiring behavior of Israel not expected of any other democratic nation.
- Using symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism to characterize Israelis.

In this tweet, the user's change in opinion upon learning about ""connections and relation to Israel/Palestine"" could be seen as applying a double standard based on the designers' national or ethnic origins. This implies that their connection to these regions is inherently problematic or negative, which aligns with the antisemitic behavior of using nationality or ethnicity (in this case, connections to Israel) to bias one's opinion.

Furthermore, the language in the tweet (""Im guilty of being completely ignorant...but now that I know? Not really"") suggests a shift in perception based solely on learning about these connections. This could be interpreted as an application of stereotypes related to Israel or Israeli individuals, potentially viewing them through a lens of suspicion or negativity simply due to their nationality or ethnic origin.

3. No antisemitic words, visual images, or deeds are present according to the examples provided in guideline 3.
4. There is no coded language expressing antisemitic sentiments, such as those mentioned in guideline 4.
5. The tweet does not involve Holocaust denial or minimization as described in guideline 5.

Furthermore, while the user mentions learning about connections between a game and Israel/Palestine, there is no indication that this newfound awareness leads to any negative conclusions or actions against Jews specifically for being Jewish (such as those covered under guidelines B.6-B.10).

Illegal and dangerous in New York. https://t.co/VouF9rDSC7,Yes,"The tweet implies antisemitism according to the IHRA definition due to several reasons:

1. **Stereotyping and Demonization**: The tweet employs a stereotype by suggesting that actions in Israel (in this case, involving an Israeli nurse) are inherently ""illegal and dangerous."" This portrayal can reinforce negative stereotypes about people from Israel or Jewish individuals more broadly.

2. **Double Standards**: It applies what could be perceived as a double standard by highlighting an incident in Israel without mentioning similar incidents elsewhere, which might suggest an expectation of different behavior for Israelis compared to others. The IHRA definition notes that applying such double standards can contribute to antisemitism.

3. **Conflation with Broader Jewish Identity**: By focusing on an action taken in Israel and implying it reflects a broader characteristic or practice, there is an indirect conflation between Israeli policies/actions and Jews worldwide. This aligns with the IHRA's point about holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

4. **Potential for Incitement**: The tweet could incite negative sentiments toward Israelis or people perceived to be Jewish by presenting a scenario in a sensational manner, which can contribute to an environment where antisemitism might thrive.

While the tweet does not explicitly use classic antisemitic language or symbols, its implications and the context it potentially sets fit several aspects of the IHRA definition. It portrays actions linked with Israel (and by extension, possibly Jews) in a negative light using stereotypes and double standards, which can be considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question describes an anecdote about a nurse in Israel who administered a vaccine to a pizza delivery person before its expiration, which the author of the tweet characterizes as ""illegal and dangerous"" based on their comparison with standards from New York.

1. **Discrimination or Hostility Against Jews**: The tweet does not explicitly target Jews as a group or Jewish institutions, nor does it express hostility towards them simply because they are Jewish. It describes an action taken by an individual in Israel without attributing that behavior to Jews collectively.

2. **Essentializing or Negative Generalizations About Jews**: There is no sweeping negative generalization made about Jews themselves; rather, the tweet focuses on a specific event involving individuals (a nurse and a pizza delivery person) in a particular context (Israel).

3. **Linking Jews with Evil or Conspiracy**: The JDA highlights that classic antisemitism often involves linking Jews to evil forces or conspiracies. This tweet does not make any such links or suggest hidden agendas attributed to Jewish people as a group.

4. **Coded Speech**: Although the tweet mentions an event in Israel, it doesn't employ coded language about Jews controlling or being inherently problematic. It references a single incident without broader implications for Jewish people or communities.

5. **Holocaust Denial**: There is no mention of denying or minimizing historical events such as the Holocaust, which is specifically highlighted in the JDA as antisemitic.

6. **Criticism of Israel vs. Antisemitism**: According to the guidelines under section B, criticism of Israel's actions, policies, or practices is not inherently antisemitic. The tweet describes a specific incident without broad condemnation or stereotyping that would fall into the realm of antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

In summary, while the tweet criticizes an action in Israel and mentions it could be seen as ""illegal and dangerous,"" there are no indications of it being inherently antisemitic. It does not involve essentializing Jews, making sweeping generalizations about them, or linking them to evil. Therefore, according to the JDA's definition, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

1. **Comparison with Nazi Ideology**: By drawing a parallel between the Civil Rights Movement in the United States and the ""Palestine movement,"" which is described as having an existence based on ""genocide and/or ethnic cleansing of Jews"" since before modern Israel was established, the tweet employs a comparison to Nazi actions against Jews. This aligns with the IHRA definition's point about drawing comparisons between contemporary Israeli policy and that of the Nazis.

2. **Conspiracy and Collective Blame**: The language implies that the raison d'être of the Palestinian movement is intrinsically linked to antisemitic themes such as genocide or ethnic cleansing, which can be seen as an accusation leveled against a collective group—Palestinian supporters—in relation to Jews. This feeds into the stereotype or conspiracy narrative that portrays Jewish communities in terms of victimization on a global scale.

3. **Undermining Legitimate Historical Struggles**: By suggesting that the Civil Rights Movement's quest for equality is somehow less legitimate than what it portrays as inherently genocidal motives behind the Palestinian movement, it can be seen as dehumanizing or demonizing one group to elevate another based on collective identity rather than specific actions. This reflects the antisemitic act of making mendacious and dehumanizing allegations about Jews.

Overall, by using language that draws comparisons with Nazi atrocities and attributing genocidal intentions to a movement associated with Jewish history and existence, the tweet exhibits elements defined as antisemitic according to the IHRA framework.",No,"The tweet in question compares the Black American civil rights movement with the Palestinian movement, emphasizing that the latter has been associated with ""genocide and/or ethnic cleansing of Jews."" To determine if this tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze it against the provided guidelines.

1. **General Context**: The tweet does not engage in essentializing or making sweeping negative generalizations about Jewish people as a whole, which would constitute racism and antisemitism under guideline 1.

2. **Linkage to Evil**: It doesn’t explicitly link Jews to forces of evil or suggest that Jews possess hidden power used against others (guideline 2). The tweet does not make claims like those about Jewish control over governments or media, nor does it propagate any anti-Jewish fantasies.

3. **Manifestation in Words/Deeds**: While the tweet uses strong language comparing movements, it doesn’t use antisemitic words that directly attack Jews or Jewish institutions (guideline 3).

4. **Direct or Indirect Speech**: The statement is direct and refers to historical claims about the Palestinian movement rather than using coded speech against Jews (guideline 4). It does not involve coded language targeting Jews as inherently evil or conspiratorial.

5. **Holocaust Denial**: There is no denial or minimization of the Holocaust in this tweet, so guideline 5 is not applicable.

6. **Israel and Palestine Context**: The tweet discusses comparisons between movements rather than directly applying antisemitic symbols or stereotypes to Israel (guideline 6). It does not hold Jews collectively responsible for actions of Israel or demand that Jews publicly condemn Zionism (guidelines 7 and 8).

7. **Criticism of Israel**: While it makes a contentious comparison, the tweet does criticize the Palestinian movement's stated goals rather than Israel itself. According to guidelines 11-15, criticizing policies or movements associated with Israel is not inherently antisemitic if done in good faith based on evidence.

In summary, while the language used is provocative and potentially inflammatory due to its comparison, it doesn't meet the JDA criteria for antisemitism as defined by these specific guidelines. The tweet does not engage in discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish) per the JDA definition.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Words mean things.",Yes,"**

The tweet suggests that labeling the actions of the Israeli government as genocide or apartheid is incorrect, implying that such accusations are exaggerated or false. According to the IHRA definition and examples provided:

1. **Denying the Holocaust**: This includes accusing Jews, including Jewish citizens in Israel, of exaggerating or inventing the Holocaust. By extension, this can apply to denying or minimizing other historical atrocities associated with Jewish history, like using terms such as ""genocide"" or ""apartheid,"" which are reminiscent of the Nazi genocide.

2. **Applying Double Standards**: The IHRA definition notes that applying double standards by requiring Israel a behavior not expected of any other democratic nation can be antisemitic. By dismissing accusations against Israel while accepting them for other nations, this tweet could imply such a standard is being applied only to Israel.

3. **Collective Responsibility and Conspiracies**: Although the tweet does not directly suggest that all Jews are responsible for Israeli policies, it implies skepticism about allegations of serious crimes like genocide or apartheid, which could be interpreted as aligning with conspiracy narratives if seen in conjunction with other similar rhetoric.

4. **Broader Context**: While criticizing a government is not inherently antisemitic, according to the IHRA definition, it becomes problematic when such criticism uses antisemitic stereotypes or minimizes historical Jewish suffering by drawing inappropriate parallels (like equating Israeli policies with Nazi actions).

In this case, the tweet's emphasis on dismissing certain accusations could potentially align with these elements of antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. Therefore, while context matters, in its stated form, it can be interpreted to fit within the framework of behaviors that are considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet in question emphasizes the importance of not exaggerating or misrepresenting the situation regarding Israel's actions by using terms like ""genocide"" or ""apartheid"" when they do not accurately describe the circumstances. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews, and includes certain forms of speech that perpetuate harmful stereotypes or deny historical facts.

In this tweet, the user is advising against the misuse of specific terms, which can be seen as a call for responsible discourse. The JDA guidelines recognize that not all criticism of Israel equates to antisemitism (Guideline 13), and this includes evidence-based criticism of its policies and practices. Importantly, while some may interpret certain kinds of criticism or comparisons involving Israel with other historical events (such as apartheid) as contentious or excessive, the JDA acknowledges that these do not inherently constitute antisemitism unless they cross into specific criteria outlined in the guidelines.

The tweet does not explicitly employ harmful stereotypes against Jews or Judaism, nor does it deny the Holocaust or engage in other forms of speech categorized under antisemitic behavior per the JDA. Instead, it focuses on promoting accuracy and integrity in discussions about Israel's policies. Therefore, this tweet is considered non-antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines.",1,0,1,0,0,0

1. **Double Standards**: The tweet implies that Israel has a unique capacity or inclination towards oppression, which aligns with the IHRA example regarding double standards. This aspect singles out Israel in a manner not applied to other countries, expecting different behavior from it than is expected from any other democratic nation.

2. **Negative Stereotyping and Demonization**: The language used in the tweet employs a generalizing and demonizing statement about an entire country and, by extension, its people. Such sweeping negative characterizations contribute to harmful stereotypes that are part of antisemitic rhetoric according to the IHRA definition.

3. **Collective Blame**: By attributing the quality of oppression specifically and uniquely to Israel, it can be argued that this tweet holds all Israeli citizens collectively responsible for actions attributed to their state, another example outlined in the IHRA working definition as an aspect of antisemitism.

4. **Contextual Understanding**: The overall context in which such statements are made—especially if part of a broader discourse or pattern of behavior towards Israel and Jews more generally—further strengthens the interpretation that this could be seen as motivated by antisemitic bias, per the IHRA guidelines.

Therefore, when considering these points within the framework provided by the IHRA working definition, it is reasonable to classify the tweet as exhibiting antisemitic characteristics.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish. The tweet in question states, ""@swilkinsonbc No country knows how to oppress people as much as Israel does!"" This statement is directed at the state of Israel and critiques its actions rather than targeting Jews as a group or Jewish institutions.

Under the JDA guidelines, specifically under section B (Israel and Palestine: examples that, on the face of it, are not antisemitic), guideline 13 acknowledges that evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state is not inherently antisemitic. This includes its policies and practices both domestically and internationally. The tweet falls within this category, as it appears to critique Israel's actions without invoking anti-Jewish stereotypes or linking the Jewish people to evil.

The tweet does not contain elements such as essentializing Jews, attributing malicious collective intentions to them, or utilizing symbols of classical antisemitism (as outlined in guidelines 2 and 3). It also avoids holding all Jews collectively responsible for Israel's actions (guideline 7) or requiring a public condemnation of Israel solely based on Jewish identity (guideline 8).

Therefore, while the statement is critical and may be perceived as contentious by some, it does not meet the JDA’s definition of antisemitism when assessed against its guidelines.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Many of these new immigrants are now the very Israeli militants that occupy the West Bank illegal settlements. https://t.co/rS3wYLvF20",Yes,"** 

The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism due to several key elements:

1. **Accusation and Conspiracy Allegations**: The tweet implies a conspiracy by suggesting that funds intended for resettlement have been used to finance militants involved in illegal settlements. This aligns with the IHRA examples of antisemitism, which include ""mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such"" and charging Jews (or their institutions) with conspiring against others.

2. **Blame Assignment**: The tweet indirectly assigns responsibility to Jewish immigrants for creating a situation involving conflict, which can be seen as blaming Jews for ""real or imagined wrongdoing."" This fits within the framework of antisemitism by holding an entire group accountable based on actions attributed to some individuals associated with them (in this case, Israeli militants).

3. **Negative Stereotyping**: The framing suggests that financial aid was misused for harmful activities, which could be seen as employing negative stereotypes about Jews and their influence or intentions.

4. **Overall Context of Criticism**: While criticism of the state of Israel is not inherently antisemitic, the context here involves suggesting a deliberate misuse of funds by immigrants who are Jewish, veering into territory that overlaps with antisemitic tropes about financial manipulation and hidden agendas.

Given these factors, the tweet exhibits characteristics that align with the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, as it implies malicious intent or wrongdoing on the part of Jewish individuals involved in this context.",No,"The tweet in question provides historical information regarding the allocation of US funds to support Jewish resettlement in Israel between 1973 and 1991. It connects these funds to the presence of Israeli militants in West Bank settlements today, but does not use language that matches any of the antisemitic criteria outlined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

Here’s how the tweet aligns with or diverges from the JDA guidelines:

1. **General Guidelines**: The tweet does not make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews or treat character traits as inherent to all Jewish people. It does not link Jews to evil forces, which is a key aspect of classic antisemitism according to guideline 2.

2. **Manifestation in Words and Deeds**: The content does not contain derogatory language or imagery that fits the antisemitic examples provided in guidelines 3 (e.g., claiming all Jews are wealthy or unpatriotic).

3. **Direct/Indirect, Explicit/Coded Language**: While it discusses a specific historical context involving Jewish migrants and Israeli militants, it does so without coded antisemitic language. There is no indication that the tweet equates these groups with negative stereotypes of Jews (guideline 4). 

4. **Holocaust Denial**: The tweet does not deny or minimize the Holocaust, which would be considered antisemitic under guideline 5.

For guidelines specifically related to Israel and Palestine:

6-10: These deal primarily with applying classical antisemitic symbols/images/stereotypes to Israel or Jews collectively responsible for Israel's actions. This tweet does not equate Jewish people as a whole to Israeli military actions nor uses negative stereotypes of Jews in its discussion about financial support for immigration.

11-15: The tweet discusses political and historical facts without advocating against the right of Jews to exist or flourish, without imposing collective responsibility on all Jews for Israel's policies (guideline 7), nor does it use disproportionate criticism or double standards specifically targeting Jewish people as antisemitic.

The tweet may be contentious or subject to interpretation regarding its perspective on Israeli politics and US policy, but according to the JDA definition provided, it does not constitute antisemitism.

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism can include making mendacious (false) and demonizing allegations about Jews as a collective group or accusing them of conspiring to harm humanity. 

1. **Mendacious Allegations**: The tweet references claims such as ""Israel admits harvesting Palestinian organs,"" ""lies on 'forced contraception' of Ethiopian women by Israeli doctors,"" and ""confirmed targeting"" of hospitals in Gaza, which are described with skepticism (e.g., using terms like ""dodgy & partial correction"" and ""lies""). These allegations fit the pattern of spreading false or misleading information about Israel that can be perceived as antisemitic if they imply malicious intentions or actions on a collective level.

2. **Collective Blame**: By associating these examples with Israel, the tweet could contribute to the stereotype of Jews being involved in conspiratorial or harmful actions globally, even when such claims are debunked or exaggerated.

3. **Historical and Stereotypical Patterns**: Such allegations often mirror classic antisemitic tropes where Jews or Jewish communities are depicted as deceitful or harmful. The use of terms like ""dodgy"" and ""lies"" can perpetuate a negative image, reinforcing stereotypes that align with the IHRA definition.

Therefore, while the tweet does not explicitly state hate speech against Jews, it propagates false narratives that fit within the examples provided by the IHRA as potentially antisemitic manifestations.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is defined specifically in terms of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The guidelines provided focus on identifying antisemitic actions and expressions that generalize negative traits about Jews collectively, link Jews with evil, or hold them responsible for state policies like those of Israel.

The tweet in question cites instances where claims were made regarding controversial allegations about Israeli activities (e.g., ""Israel admits harvesting Palestinian organs,"" ""forced contraception"" of Ethiopian women, ""confirmed targeting"" of hospitals in Gaza). These are criticisms directed at the actions attributed to the state of Israel rather than Jews as a whole. The JDA guidelines distinguish between antisemitic and non-antisemitic criticism by emphasizing that evidence-based criticism of Israeli policies or actions is not inherently antisemitic.

1. **Targeting State Actions, Not Jews**: The tweet references specific claims about government conduct, which aligns with guideline 13. Criticism directed at the state of Israel as a political entity does not automatically translate to prejudice against Jews individually or collectively.

2. **Nature of Claims**: The examples mentioned involve controversial actions attributed to the state and its policies rather than attributing any intrinsic negative characteristics to Jewish people. Therefore, they do not fall under guideline 2, which involves linking Jews with evil.

3. **Lack of Generalization Against Jews**: There is no evidence in the tweet that it generalizes or essentializes Jews as a whole. The JDA guidelines caution against making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews (guideline A1), but this tweet does not do so.

1. **Conflation of Judaism and Israel**: The tweet conflates Jewish people with the actions of the state of Israel, which is a common manifestation of modern antisemitism. This kind of conflation often implies collective responsibility or attributes specific national policies directly to Jews as a religious group.

2. **Use of Religious Criticism in a Political Context**: By invoking God’s abandonment due to the actions of ""Israel,"" it employs religious criticism that targets Jews indirectly by associating them with Israel's political decisions. This can be interpreted as drawing an analogy between modern-day Israel and biblical narratives, which is often used in antisemitic rhetoric.

3. **Implication of Divine Retribution**: The statement implies a divine punishment specifically targeting ""Israel"" when they turn away from God, indirectly suggesting that Jewish people are under scrutiny or threat due to their religious identity. This can be seen as part of the broader antisemitic trope where Jews are portrayed in a negative light based on their religious beliefs and practices.

4. **Historical Context**: The use of religious themes related to divine punishment has historically been used in antisemitic rhetoric, such as the blood libel or claims about Jewish disloyalty. This tweet evokes similar imagery by suggesting that God's abandonment is linked to Israel's actions.

Overall, while the tweet may be framed within a religious discourse, it employs elements and implications that align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, particularly through the conflation of Judaism with the state of Israel’s policies and invoking negative stereotypes.",No,"The tweet in question reads: ""“Did you know what happened to Israel when they turned back from God?

1. **Definition Analysis**: The tweet does not involve any explicit discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence towards Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish. It refers to ""Israel"" in a religious context rather than directly targeting Jews or Judaism.

2. **Guideline A Considerations**:
   - **Essentialization and Negative Generalizations (1)**: The tweet does not essentialize or make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews.
   - **Linking Jews with Evil (2)**: It does not link Jews with evil, conspiracy theories, or suggest hidden Jewish power or control over governments, banks, media, etc.
   - **Manifestations in Words/Deeds (3)**: The language used does not employ antisemitic words or imagery, nor does it describe any antisemitic deeds.

3. **Guideline B Considerations**:
   - **Israel and Classical Antisemitism (6-10)**: While the tweet discusses Israel’s relationship with God, it doesn't apply symbols, images, or negative stereotypes of classical antisemitism to Israel, nor does it hold Jews collectively responsible for Israel's actions. It makes no demands on Jewish individuals regarding their stance on Israel and does not question their right to exist.

4. **Guideline C Considerations**:
   - The tweet is focused on a theological interpretation rather than political or national criticism of Israel. It critiques the biblical narrative involving Israel, which is separate from criticisms directed at contemporary Israeli policies or practices (as outlined in guidelines 11-15).

Here's how:

1. **Double Standards:** The tweet implies that professionals at an organization are getting paid by a ""regime lobby,"" hinting at ulterior motives tied specifically to their stance on Israel. This can be seen as applying a double standard where Israel is held to a different set of expectations or scrutiny compared to other countries.

2. **Historical Context and Stereotyping:** The reference to Israel's involvement in ending Iraq’s nuclear program may indirectly suggest negative character traits about Jewish people or Israelis, associating them with covert operations that harm other nations. This plays into stereotypes about Jews having disproportionate power and influence on global affairs.

3. **Conspiracy Implication:** While not explicitly stating a world Jewish conspiracy, the implication that these professionals are influenced by an external ""regime lobby"" can resonate with antisemitic themes where Jews or Israeli entities are perceived to manipulate international events for their benefit.

Overall, while the tweet does not overtly include all elements from the IHRA definition, its implications and tone contribute to a broader narrative of suspicion and criticism uniquely directed at Israel/Jews in a way that aligns with documented examples of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question does not appear to fit the definition of antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

   - It does not invoke classic antisemitic themes such as linking Jews to evil forces, conspiracies, or control over governments, media, or finance.

2. **Israel and Palestine Specifics**:
   - The content of the tweet is related to Israel's political actions rather than Jewish people in general. It discusses Israel's involvement in ending Iraq's nuclear program.
   - There are no symbols, images, or negative stereotypes of classical antisemitism applied to Jews or Jewish institutions.

3. **Coded Language and Context**:

By suggesting a situation where a Jewish person (or those associated with Judaism through marriage) would not receive the same opportunity as someone of another faith, it indirectly insinuates distrust towards Jews' allegiance to their country.

2. **Implying Hypocrisy or Duplicity**: The tweet implies that if Malia Obama were involved in such a scenario, it would be unimaginable due to potential backlash influenced by Jewish connections and influence over U.S. politics. This aligns with the IHRA's mention of antisemitism involving accusations against Jews for conspiring to harm humanity or wielding undue power, suggesting a global manipulation or control that is often seen in classic antisemitic narratives.

3. **Collective Blame**: The tweet hints at collective responsibility by questioning Jewish identity and privilege while implicitly attributing disproportionate influence on political matters (e.g., Israeli-Palestinian conflict) to Jewish connections, which can be perceived as aligning with the IHRA's description of holding Jews collectively responsible for actions attributed to others.

4. **Contextual Analysis**: The tweet uses a hypothetical situation involving a high-profile Jewish family and their potential impact on sensitive geopolitical issues, which could perpetuate harmful stereotypes about Jewish power or influence that are often present in antisemitic rhetoric.

2. **Essentializing Traits (Guideline 1)**: The question ""Are Jews white?"" could be interpreted as an inquiry into racial identity rather than a statement essentializing Jews with inherent negative traits. It does not make sweeping generalizations about Jews.

Furthermore, by singling out Jews alongside Christians as targets, while also mentioning other groups like Buddhists, Hindus, and secular people, it potentially reinforces the stereotype that Jews are particularly vulnerable or frequently targeted in a specific way due to their identity.

Additionally, by focusing on these organizations under the umbrella term ""Islamist,"" the tweet may implicitly suggest an association between Islam and violence against Jews, thus potentially fostering or reinforcing negative stereotypes about Muslims as well. This can be seen as another form of dehumanizing rhetoric that aligns with antisemitic expressions when it involves collective blame or threat.

Overall, while the tweet includes other groups as targets, its focus on the listing of organizations targeting Jews and Christians can contribute to a perception of antisemitism by suggesting an organized, collective threat against these communities, particularly the Jewish community.

2. **Linkage with Evil (Guideline 2)**: There is no indication in the tweet of linking Jews as a whole to forces of evil, conspiracy theories, or portraying them as controlling nefarious entities.

3. **Manifestation through Words, Images, and Deeds (Guideline 3)**: The tweet does not use antisemitic language, imagery, or suggest harmful actions against Jewish individuals or institutions based on their identity.

4. **Direct or Indirect Language (Guideline 4)**: The content of the tweet is direct in listing specific organizations without coded language about Jews possessing negative inherent traits or being linked to evil forces.

5. **Holocaust Denial (Guideline 5)**: There is no denial, minimization, or distortion of the Holocaust mentioned.

Priorities are all wrong.",Yes,"** The tweet in question contains elements that can be interpreted as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Here’s a breakdown of why this determination is made:

1. **Defamatory Language and Stereotyping**: The mention of Glyn Secker calling someone a ""fifth columnist"" along with saying ""Jews were in the gutter with rats"" employs both defamatory language and stereotypical imagery. Associating Jews with derogatory terms like ""in the gutter with rats"" invokes harmful stereotypes that have historically been used to dehumanize Jewish people. This aligns with the IHRA definition's example of using ""mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews.""

2. **Collective Blame**: The tweet suggests a generalized statement about Jews (""Jews were in the gutter with rats""), which implies collective blame or negative character traits being attributed to Jewish people as a group. This fits within the IHRA definition's description of antisemitism that involves ""accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing.""

3. **Perception and Impact**: Even though the tweet is a report of someone else’s comments rather than an expression of personal belief, it communicates and potentially amplifies those harmful views, impacting how Jewish individuals are perceived in public discourse.

In conclusion, the language used and the nature of the accusations reported in the tweet align with several aspects of the IHRA's definition of antisemitism. Therefore, this tweet can be considered as containing antisemitic content according to that framework.",No,"The tweet in question mentions an individual named Glyn Secker who allegedly made disparaging remarks about Jews, describing them negatively and associating them with rats. However, the content of the tweet itself does not contain any direct expressions or actions that demonstrate discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition.

1. **Absence of Direct Hostility**: The tweet criticizes another individual's behavior and expresses concern about priorities but does not directly exhibit antisemitic sentiment from its author towards Jews or Jewish entities. 

2. **Contextual Indirect Reference**: While the tweet refers to someone else making potentially antisemitic comments, it does not adopt those sentiments as its own nor does it perpetuate them further.

3. **Criticism of Inaction**: The primary focus appears to be on addressing perceived inaction or misprioritization by an unspecified authority regarding a complaint about Secker's behavior. This criticism is directed at the handling process rather than any Jewish individuals or groups.

4. **No Manifestation as Defined**: There are no words, visual images, or deeds expressed within this tweet that fit the examples of antisemitic actions outlined in guidelines 3 or elsewhere in the JDA definition, such as denying the Holocaust, applying negative stereotypes to Jews, or linking them inherently with evil.

Given these points, while the referenced comments by Glyn Secker might be considered antisemitic if analyzed separately, the tweet itself does not meet the criteria of expressing antisemitism according to the JDA.",1,0,1,0,0,0

In other words, it's bollox! #JC4PM",Yes,"** The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it engages in several elements that align with manifestations of antisemitism:

1. **Dismissal of Concerns as ""Bollocks"":** By dismissing significant concerns within a specific community (British Jews regarding Jeremy Corbyn's perceived antisemitism) with a pejorative term, the tweet undermines and trivializes their legitimate fears and experiences. This can contribute to an environment where Jewish voices are marginalized or disregarded.

2. **Undermining Legitimacy of Concerns:** The tweet suggests that concerns about antisemitism from a subset of the Jewish community should not be taken seriously due to the small sample size of the survey, which may imply that these Jews are either wrong in their perceptions or are overreacting. This can contribute to stereotypes of Jews as overly sensitive or conspiratorial, which are elements found in classic antisemitic rhetoric.

3. **Potential for Incitement:** While not overtly calling for harm against Jews, the dismissive language could potentially incite further division and hostility towards those within the Jewish community who voice concerns about antisemitism. This can contribute to an environment where antisemitic attitudes are normalized or emboldened.

4. **Contextual Implications:** The tweet's content, especially in a public platform like Twitter, reflects a lack of sensitivity to how such statements might be perceived by those concerned with antisemitism and Jewish security. It aligns with the IHRA's point that criticism should not undermine legitimate concerns about antisemitic attitudes or actions.

Overall, while the tweet does not explicitly engage in classic antisemitic stereotypes, its dismissive tone towards Jewish concerns about potential antisemitism can be seen as perpetuating a harmful narrative that minimizes these concerns and contributes to an environment where such sentiments are trivialized. This aligns with aspects of the IHRA definition concerning the portrayal and treatment of Jews based on prejudicial views.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews because they are Jewish or against Jewish institutions as Jewish. The tweet in question criticizes statistical data regarding British Jews' perceptions of Jeremy Corbyn and questions its validity due to the small sample size used. It does not express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as a group nor does it use antisemitic stereotypes or imagery.

1. **Content Analysis**: The tweet challenges the reliability of certain statistics rather than making negative generalizations about Jewish people. It disputes the conclusions drawn from statistical data due to what is perceived as inadequate sampling and questions the validity of claims regarding Jewish emigration based on those statistics. There are no direct expressions of hostility or prejudice toward Jews.

2. **Absence of Stereotyping**: The tweet does not invoke any antisemitic stereotypes, such as portraying Jews as wealthy, untrustworthy, or conspiratorial in nature. It focuses solely on the methodology and implications of a specific survey without attributing these concerns to Jewish people generally.

3. **No Hostility or Violence**: There is no indication of hostility or violence toward Jews or Jewish institutions within the tweet. The language used is critical of statistical data rather than being directed at Jewish individuals or communities.

4. **Contextual Considerations**: While the context surrounding political debates can sometimes heighten sensitivity, particularly when discussing antisemitism allegations against public figures like Jeremy Corbyn, it's important to distinguish between legitimate criticism and antisemitic speech. The tweet does not fall into categories outlined by JDA guidelines that would classify it as antisemitic.

In summary, while the tone of the tweet might be critical or dismissive toward particular statistical findings regarding Jewish opinions on a political matter, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

1. **Stereotyping and Demonization**: The tweet implies a monolithic behavior among Jewish people, suggesting they uniformly support or abandon political parties based on perceived levels of antisemitism. This aligns with the IHRA's identification of demonizing allegations about Jews as a collective.

2. **Political Double Standards**: By calling for a ""Jewish BLEXIT"" from the Democratic Party in the U.S., while referencing Jewish support shifts in the UK, it applies political double standards to Israel-related criticisms, similar to how criticism of Israel can sometimes be antisemitic when not applied equally to other countries.

3. **Conspiracy and Influence Allegations**: The hashtags ""#DemocratAntiSemitism"" and ""#JewishBLEXIT"" suggest a conspiracy where Jews are implied to have undue influence over political parties or their decisions, aligning with the IHRA's mention of conspiratorial stereotypes about Jewish control.

4. **Contextual Understanding**: While it is not explicitly antisemitic to discuss political affiliations or changes in support among any group, including Jewish communities, framing these shifts as a collective action against perceived antisemitism can reinforce negative stereotypes and portray Jews as manipulatively influencing politics, which falls within the scope of contemporary examples of antisemitism outlined by the IHRA.

Therefore, considering the context and content of the tweet, it propagates harmful stereotypes and perceptions about Jewish people, fitting several elements of the IHRA's definition.",No,"**

The tweet compares the decline in Jewish support for the UK Labour Party due to perceived antisemitism with a call for Jews in the Democratic Party to similarly ""exit"" if they perceive rising antisemitism. This comparison and call are not inherently antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

1. **General Context:** The tweet discusses political support and perceptions of antisemitism within two different political parties—one in the UK and one in the US—and uses these as examples to prompt action or awareness.

2. **Lack of Stereotyping or Prejudice Against Jews as Jews:** The tweet does not essentialize Jewish characteristics, make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews, or attribute evil intentions to them collectively. It does not portray Jews in a derogatory way or imply inherent negative traits based on their religion or ethnicity.

3. **Focus on Political Actions:** The core of the message is political critique aimed at addressing concerns regarding antisemitism within specific parties, rather than targeting Jewish individuals or institutions as Jews.

4. **Absence of Classic Antisemitic Imagery:** It does not use symbols, images, or stereotypes typically associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., conspiracy theories about hidden power).

5. **Criticism of Institutions, Not People:** The criticism is directed at political parties perceived to harbor antisemitic elements, rather than targeting Jewish people themselves.

6. **Coded Language and Contextual Judgement:** While it uses the term ""Jewish #BLEXIT,"" which may evoke historical or contemporary political movements, within this context, it serves more as a metaphorical call for re-evaluation of political support in response to concerns about antisemitism rather than an implicit attack on Jewish people.

Therefore, based on these considerations and according to the JDA guidelines, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism. It is important to note that while it may be controversial or provocative in its attempt to draw parallels between political dynamics in different countries, it does not inherently express prejudice, hostility, or discrimination against Jews as Jews.",1,0,1,0,0,0

It suggests a problematic generalization about Jews by implying they are unable to choose their leadership or represent themselves adequately within their community. This falls under ""accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations,"" as it questions the legitimacy and representative nature of a religious authority figure within the Jewish community.

Additionally, by referring to Chief Rabbi Mirvis' actions in an extremely negative light and suggesting he is dishonestly manipulating situations for attention, this tweet potentially leverages stereotypes about Jewish behavior. Although not directly referencing classic antisemitic symbols or Holocaust denial, it uses language that could contribute to a perception of Jews as manipulative or deceitful, which aligns with ""employing sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.""

While the tweet does not explicitly accuse Jews of global conspiracies or control over societal institutions, its dismissive tone towards Jewish leadership might be interpreted as undermining the cohesion and self-determination within the Jewish community. This indirect form of criticism may feed into broader antisemitic narratives about Jewish disunity or manipulation, especially when considering the IHRA's emphasis on context in determining whether an expression is antisemitic.

Overall, while not overtly antisemitic, the tweet’s implications and tone could be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes and questioning the legitimacy of Jewish communal structures, thereby fitting within a broader understanding of antisemitism as defined by the IHRA.",No,"The tweet criticizes Chief Rabbi Mirvis and his involvement in an event related to Labour's race+faith launch, focusing on the nature of his position and its perceived influence.

2. **No Stereotyping or Generalizations**: There are no sweeping negative generalizations about Jews or Jewish institutions inherent in the tweet. It does not essentialize Jewish people or link them to evil, which is a key aspect of antisemitism defined by JDA guidelines 1 and 2.

3. **Focus on Role and Actions**: The critique pertains specifically to Rabbi Mirvis's role (described as ""unelected"") and his actions at an event, not implying collective Jewish responsibility or influence over broader political matters.

According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, one of the manifestations of antisemitism includes employing sinister stereotypes and negative character traits about Jews. The tweet specifically mentions language that dehumanizes Jews, which aligns with these aspects of the IHRA definition.

The use of such dehumanizing language can contribute to an environment where discrimination or violence against Jews becomes more likely because it portrays them in a way that diminishes their humanity. This fits the IHRA's description of antisemitic rhetoric as it involves harmful stereotypes and negative characterizations directed towards Jewish individuals or groups.

Although the tweet also mentions other ""undesirables,"" its specific reference to language used against Jews satisfies the criteria outlined by the IHRA for what constitutes antisemitism.

1. **Historical Context:** The tweet alludes to past events where derogatory terms were used against Jews during the Holocaust. It highlights a method of dehumanization that was part of historical atrocities, rather than expressing or promoting current discrimination or prejudice against Jews.

2. **Lack of Contemporary Prejudice:** According to the JDA guidelines, antisemitism involves contemporary discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). The tweet does not make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews today, nor does it suggest that Jews possess inherent characteristics tied to evil, power, or control over modern entities like governments or media.

3. **Educational Purpose:** It seems the intention of the tweet is to educate or inform about historical injustices rather than incite contemporary antisemitic sentiment. The focus is on how language was used to dehumanize and justify inhumane treatment historically.

4. **No Direct Hostility or Generalizations:** There are no explicit hostile statements, negative generalizations, or coded messages directed at Jews today within the tweet. It does not fulfill the criteria of antisemitic speech outlined in the JDA guidelines, such as attributing inherent negative traits to Jews or depicting them through negative stereotypes.

1. **Collective Blame**: The statement criticizes the practice of using ""Jews"" when discussing war crimes in Palestine, implying that such discussions wrongfully attribute collective blame to all Jewish people for actions related to Israel. This aligns with the IHRA definition's point about antisemitism frequently involving charges against Jews as a collectivity, especially regarding the state of Israel.

2. **Double Standards**: The tweet suggests a perceived double standard in how different groups are criticized or blamed, implying that criticism of Israelis is unfairly generalized to all Jewish people worldwide. This touches on the IHRA examples related to applying double standards and demanding behavior from Israel not expected of other nations.

3. **Negative Stereotypes**: By equating criticisms directed at Israeli actions with attacks against Muslims as a whole, the tweet indirectly reinforces a negative stereotype that criticism of any aspect involving Jews (or Israelis) automatically translates into antisemitism. This can contribute to the perception of Jews being collectively held responsible for individual or state actions.

While the intent of the tweet may be to advocate for fairness and avoid stereotyping, its framing risks reinforcing harmful generalizations about Jewish people as a whole in relation to Israeli policies, which is considered an aspect of antisemitism under the IHRA definition.",No,"** The tweet expresses concern over the generalization that associates all Jews with war crimes in Palestine, which aligns with the guidelines of the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Specifically, it highlights a sensitivity to not attributing actions of a few individuals or groups to an entire population, akin to avoiding stereotypes about Muslims when discussing negative incidents. This sentiment is consistent with guideline 1 under ""General,"" which emphasizes that essentializing or making sweeping generalizations about any group, including Jews, is racist and forms part of antisemitism.

The tweet does not display hostility, prejudice, or discrimination against Jews as Jews; rather, it critiques a behavior (generalization) that could lead to such outcomes. It calls for respect by avoiding the same kind of broad-brush blame applied to other groups when discussing actions committed by some individuals within those groups. This is more about advocating for fairness and accurate representation in discourse.

The tweet does not employ words, images, or deeds that directly target Jews with discrimination or hostility as per guideline 3. Furthermore, it doesn't imply any inherent negative traits of Jewish people nor uses imagery or language typical of antisemitic stereotypes (guideline 2).

Specifically:

1. **Conspiracy Allegations**: The phrase ""The Odd Link"" implies a conspiracy or hidden connection that may not be overtly visible but is nonetheless significant. This aligns with the IHRA's mention of accusations of Jews conspiring to harm humanity.

2. **Stereotyping and Demonizing**: By suggesting an association between American Jews and the alt-right—a group often associated with extremist and radical ideologies—the tweet could be seen as employing stereotypes that portray Jewish individuals collectively in a negative light.

3. **Collective Blame**: The wording implies that American Jews, as a collective, have some kind of relationship or involvement with alt-right extremism. This can be viewed as blaming an entire group for actions that may be associated with just a subset or unrelated to them.

4. **Public Perception and Harm**: Such statements in public media can contribute to harmful perceptions of Jewish communities, potentially inciting prejudice or hostility, which is another dimension the IHRA definition seeks to address.

While it's important to consider context and intention, based on the information provided, the tweet appears to fit within several categories outlined by the IHRA as examples of antisemitic rhetoric.",No,"**

To determine whether the tweet ""Donald Trump: The Odd Link between American Jews and the Alt-Right"" is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze its content in light of the JDA's definition and guidelines.

1. **Content Analysis:** The title suggests a connection or relationship between American Jews and the alt-right, which may imply an exploration or commentary rather than expressing prejudice or hostility directly. However, without access to the full article, we cannot assume what this link might entail. 

2. **Guideline 2 (JDA):** This guideline discusses how antisemitism often involves portraying Jews as linked to malevolent forces or conspiracies. If the article argues or implies that American Jews inherently support or are allied with harmful ideologies like those of the alt-right, it could be considered antisemitic. However, simply posing a question about links does not automatically imply such an essentializing or conspiratorial view.

3. **Guideline 4 (JDA):** This guideline highlights coded antisemitism and requires context to identify such implications. Without additional context showing that the article employs harmful stereotypes or suggests inherent traits of Jewish people supporting alt-right ideologies, it is not sufficient evidence to label the tweet as antisemitic on its own.

4. **Consideration of Intent:** Often, headlines alone do not provide enough information about intent or content to determine if they are antisemitic. The headline might be provocative or designed to attract attention without embodying antisemitic views.

5. **Absence of Direct Antisemitic Content:** The title itself does not include any explicit antisemitic language or imagery, nor does it directly accuse Jews of negative behaviors as a collective group (in line with guideline 3).

6. **Potential for Misinterpretation:** While there is potential for misinterpretation that might lead to harmful stereotypes, the tweet alone lacks explicit content suggesting such interpretations without further context from the linked article.

Given these points, based solely on the information available in the tweet, it does not definitively meet the criteria of antisemitism as outlined by the JDA. However, a comprehensive assessment would require reviewing the full content of the referenced article to ensure no hidden antisemitic implications exist within its analysis or argumentation.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Here’s why:

1. **Implication of Conspiracy**: The tweet poses a hypothetical scenario where Malia Obama marries a Palestinian Muslim who becomes involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict under her father's presidency. By framing it as something unimaginable, it indirectly suggests that Jewish influence or control over American politics and policy toward Israel is so pervasive that such an event could not occur without hidden motivations or conspiracies.

2. **Stereotyping and Demonization**: It taps into a stereotype that Jews wield disproportionate power in political spheres, particularly regarding policies related to Israel. This aligns with the IHRA definition's example of attributing sinister stereotypes to Jews or assuming Jewish control over media, government, or other societal institutions.

3. **Double Standards and Comparisons**: The tweet implies a double standard by suggesting that such an appointment would be unthinkable, perhaps due to perceived biases against Muslims or Palestinians, while not recognizing similar scrutiny applied to Jewish individuals in political contexts. This could indirectly reinforce the stereotype of Jews as having undue influence over U.S. policy towards Israel.

4. **Conspiracy and Hostility**: The hypothetical nature of the tweet suggests an underlying hostility toward potential Jewish influence, which can be seen as contributing to a hostile environment for Jews by insinuating that they might have hidden agendas or disproportionate control.

The tweet uses a hypothetical scenario involving Malia Obama converting to Islam and marrying a Palestinian Muslim who is then put in charge of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by her father. This analogy appears to comment on racial dynamics, perceptions of privilege, and potential political controversies rather than expressing prejudice or hostility towards Jews as a group.

Additionally, it does not apply negative stereotypes associated with classical antisemitism to Israel or Jewish people (Guidelines 6 and 7).

While the tweet may touch upon sensitive topics related to race, religion, and politics, these themes alone do not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

1. **Historical Stereotypes and Accusations**: The tweet alludes to Jews being ""disloyal"" and draws a parallel between contemporary political actions (such as separating families or using serial numbers for identification) with historical atrocities like those committed during the Holocaust (""Been there. Done that""). This suggests an accusation of disloyalty and a negative stereotyping rooted in historical antisemitic myths about Jewish people.

2. **Conflation with Historical Atrocities**: By referencing experiences akin to those in concentration camps, it implies Jews are particularly susceptible or inclined towards certain political behaviors, potentially perpetuating stereotypes of collective responsibility or behavior based on ethnicity.

3. **Collective Blame and Stereotyping**: The tweet suggests a uniform response from ""most"" Jews, insinuating that Jewish identity inherently influences their political decisions in a negative way. This can be seen as an application of antisemitic tropes where Jews are collectively judged and blamed for certain actions or beliefs.

4. **Emotional Connotation**: The language used (""Fuckouttahere"") conveys strong negative emotions, which is typical of speech intended to vilify or dehumanize a group. This rhetoric further aligns with the IHRA's examples of antisemitism through expression that employs negative character traits or demonizing language.

Overall, while it does not explicitly match all elements listed in the IHRA definition, the tweet reflects themes and stereotypes consistent with antisemitic perceptions and accusations against Jewish people.",No,"The tweet in question does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

1. **Content and Context**: The tweet criticizes a political figure, presumably Donald Trump (""Donnie""), accusing him of actions that resemble those of historical figures associated with genocide and human rights abuses, such as putting people in camps and separating families. These references are to events and policies historically attributed to figures like Adolf Hitler during the Holocaust.

2. **Target**: The criticism is directed at a political figure's actions and policies rather than Jews or Jewish individuals collectively. It uses historical analogies to express disapproval of perceived similar actions by this figure, not attributing those actions specifically to any Jewish people or community.

3. **No Collective Blame on Jews**: The tweet does not hold Jews collectively responsible for the conduct mentioned (as outlined in guideline 7), nor does it apply stereotypes or imagery that are classically antisemitic as per guidelines 2 and 6.

4. **Nature of Criticism**: The language used (""Fuckouttahere"") is strong but appears to be directed at a specific political stance rather than an attack on Jewish people or institutions. It expresses personal disapproval based on historical atrocities, aiming to deter support for policies perceived as harmful.

5. **Coded Language Concerns**: While some might argue that the reference to camps could be seen as coded language, given its context and intent (criticism of a political figure's policies), it does not fulfill the antisemitic criteria outlined in guideline 4, which requires a link to Jews or Jewish institutions.

Overall, while the tweet is critical and uses strong language, it lacks elements that would classify it as antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines.

This phrase echoes the rhetoric used by white supremacists and anti-Semitic groups who promote conspiracy theories about Jewish influence and control over society. The use of this specific chant is an example of demonizing or dehumanizing Jews based on stereotypes and negative character traits.

Additionally, the tweet mentions that ""the president essentially said they were fair."" This implies a level of justification or acceptance for antisemitic sentiments, which can be seen as aiding or justifying harmful rhetoric toward Jewish individuals. Such endorsements or validations of antisemitic ideologies contribute to an environment where such views are legitimized, thereby perpetuating harm.

According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, both the direct use of antisemitic expressions and statements that justify or endorse them can be considered manifestations of antisemitism. The context provided by the tweet aligns with several examples listed in the IHRA definition, such as making dehumanizing allegations about Jews as a collective group and legitimizing harmful ideologies directed at Jewish people.

In this tweet:
- There is no explicit expression of prejudice, hostility, or a conspiratorial view linking Jews to evil.
- The tweet does not generalize negatively about Jews or Jewish institutions; rather, it addresses political and social events involving anti-Semitic rhetoric.
- It mentions the recurrence of an anti-Semitic chant from past events but does not itself propagate such ideas.
- By raising awareness about these statements, the tweet seems to critique perceived inaction or insensitivity toward anti-Semitism, which is a legitimate concern under human rights discourse.

Thus, while the tweet deals with topics related to antisemitism, it does not in and of itself contain language or actions that would classify it as antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines.

It was Trump who inspired a synagogue shooting and keeps taking the side of fascists.\n\nWith all due respect, GOP, get your fake ass concern about anti-Semitism the fuck out of here.",Yes,"The tweet contains several elements that align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism:

1. **Charging Jews as a collective**: The tweet asserts ""Most Jews are Democrats"" and implies Jewish protestors were targeted by an ICE guard, suggesting a collective identity or action among Jews. This can be seen as an example of attributing political views or actions to Jews as a whole, which aligns with the IHRA definition regarding charging Jews collectively for certain characteristics or behaviors.

2. **Demonizing allegations**: The tweet accuses Trump and his supporters (implicitly linked through ""GOP"" and ""fascists"") of being responsible for antisemitic acts such as inspiring a synagogue shooting. While criticizing political figures is not inherently antisemitic, framing the Republican Party broadly as fascists could be interpreted as demonizing or stereotyping, especially if it lacks context or factual support.

3. **Use of hostile language**: The phrase ""get your fake ass concern about anti-Semitism the fuck out of here"" employs aggressive and dismissive language towards those who express concern over antisemitism from within the GOP. This could contribute to a polarizing environment that may further stigmatize certain groups or discussions around antisemitism.

While political speech often involves strong rhetoric, this tweet crosses into potentially antisemitic territory by collectively attributing characteristics to Jews and using hostile language towards perceived opponents of these views. It is important in such cases to consider the context and intent behind the statements to fully assess their impact.",No,"**DECISION:** No

**EXPLICATION:**

The tweet in question does not meet the criteria of antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Let's break down why, according to the guidelines provided:

1. **Discrimination, Prejudice, Hostility, or Violence Against Jews:** The tweet does discuss political affiliations and events involving Jewish individuals but does not express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence specifically against Jews as a group or their institutions because they are Jewish.

2. **Generalizations About Jews:** While the tweet mentions that ""most Jews are Democrats,"" this statement is presented more in the context of political alignment rather than an essentialized or inherently negative trait. The JDA highlights racism and antisemitism when character traits are treated as inherent, but here it's a commentary on political behavior, not racial or ethnic characteristics.

3. **Linkage to Evil:** There is no implication that Jews are linked to forces of evil or conspiratorial power. The tweet criticizes specific actions by an ICE guard and associates certain political figures with these events, but does not attribute malicious intent or collective control to Jewish people as a whole.

4. **Words, Images, Deeds:** While the language is strong and critical, it targets the GOP's perceived insincerity regarding antisemitism rather than attacking Jews themselves or their institutions.

5. **Direct/Indirect Antisemitic Speech:** The tweet does not contain coded language that would suggest indirect antisemitic sentiment. It focuses on political criticism directed at a party (GOP) and its stance on antisemitism, without attributing negative stereotypes to Jewish people collectively.

6. **Denial or Minimization of the Holocaust:** There is no mention of denying or minimizing the Holocaust in this tweet.

7. **Collective Responsibility for Israel's Conduct:** The tweet does not imply that Jews are held responsible for actions by Israel or require them to condemn Israeli policies, which could be considered antisemitic under JDA guidelines.

8. **Denial of Jewish Rights in Israel:** There is no content suggesting a denial of the right of Jews to exist and flourish in Israel.

9. **Criticism of Political Entities:** The tweet criticizes political figures and actions related to them but does not engage in criticism of Israel or Zionism that would be considered antisemitic under JDA guidelines.

In conclusion, while the tone is confrontational and politically charged, it does not meet the thresholds set by the JDA for defining statements as antisemitic. The critique appears directed towards political dynamics and responses rather than an attack on Jewish people as a group.",1,0,1,0,0,0

To determine if this is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, let's examine its components:

1. **Condemning Criticism of Israel**: The tweet suggests that criticism from anti-Zionists should be opposed, which can imply a negative view towards those who criticize Israeli policies. While not all criticism of Israel constitutes antisemitism, the context provided by the IHRA indicates that such criticism becomes antisemitic if it employs ""double standards"" or parallels Israeli behavior with that of Nazis.

2. **Implication of Conspiracy**: By suggesting anti-Zionists are trying to turn Blacks against Jews, the tweet could imply a conspiracy theory where there is an orchestrated effort against Jewish people, aligning with IHRA’s note on antisemitism involving conspiratorial myths about Jews.

3. **Intercommunal Tensions**: Highlighting potential conflict between Black and Jewish communities might evoke historical stereotypes of Jews being divisive or manipulative, which can be considered a manifestation of antisemitic attitudes if it portrays Jews negatively in intergroup dynamics without justification.

4. **Contextual Analysis**: Without additional context from the linked content, it’s challenging to fully assess intent or nuance. However, based on the language used and potential implications within the tweet itself—particularly concerning anti-Zionism and intercommunal relations—it aligns with patterns of antisemitic discourse as outlined by the IHRA.

Considering these points, the tweet can be seen as potentially perpetuating antisemitic ideas, particularly through its implication of conspiracy or divisive intentions among Jews and their critics. Therefore, according to the IHRA working definition, this tweet could indeed be interpreted as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question refers to an article titled ""Deadly Exchange,"" and suggests the need to speak out against anti-Zionists who allegedly aim to turn Black communities against Jewish people. To determine whether this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must examine it against their guidelines.

1. **General Context**: The tweet does not inherently contain discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence towards Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish. It highlights a concern about anti-Zionist activities and potential inter-community tensions but does not use stereotypes or dehumanizing language associated with antisemitism.

2. **Guidelines on Israel and Palestine**: 
   - The tweet critiques anti-Zionism, which is explicitly mentioned in the JDA guidelines under examples that are ""on the face of it"" not considered antisemitic (guideline 12). Criticism of Zionism or calls for various constitutional arrangements for Jews and Palestinians fall within this scope.
   
3. **No Direct Link to Classical Antisemitism**: The tweet does not employ symbols, images, or stereotypes historically associated with antisemitism, nor does it suggest that Jews are linked to evil forces or possess a collective power used against others.

4. **Coded Speech Consideration**: There is no indication of coded speech in this tweet; the language is straightforward about addressing inter-community relations and anti-Zionist rhetoric.

In summary, while the tweet calls for vigilance against certain ideologies that might affect intergroup relations negatively, it does not meet any criteria outlined by the JDA for antisemitism. It speaks to a political concern without crossing into discrimination or prejudice specifically targeting Jews as Jews. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines provided, this tweet is not considered antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

EXPLICATION: The tweet in question could be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, although it is not overtly so and depends heavily on interpretation. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Perception of Jewish People**: The tweet suggests that Jews should support the Republican Party because they ""welcome, embraces, protects and promotes us all of the time."" This implies that Jews have an obligation to align politically in this way, which could be seen as an expectation for Jews to act uniformly or collectively, playing into the stereotype of a monolithic Jewish identity.

2. **Allegations and Stereotypes**: The claim that Democrats ""kowtow for votes"" and then ""turn their back on us"" hints at a conspiratorial view of political parties, particularly the Democratic Party, as being manipulative towards Jews. This could be interpreted as suggesting a power dynamic where Jewish support is only sought for electoral gain without genuine commitment.

3. **Collective Responsibility**: By urging all Jews to vote Republican, the tweet might imply that Jews have a collective responsibility or should act in concert when it comes to political matters. This aligns with antisemitic narratives of Jews being collectively accountable and needing to act as a unified group for certain interests.

4. **Political Context and Motivation**: While criticism of political parties is not inherently antisemitic, the framing here can reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish people's loyalty or influence in politics. It suggests a dichotomy where only one party is portrayed as truly supportive, echoing themes of collective loyalty and conspiratorial manipulation that are central to many antisemitic ideologies.

Overall, while the tweet does not explicitly use language typically associated with antisemitism, its underlying implications can be interpreted through an antisemitic lens given these points.",No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly demonstrate antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition. Let's break down why, based on the guidelines provided by JDA:

1. **Essentialization or Generalizations (Guideline 1):** The tweet does not essentialize Jews as possessing inherent negative characteristics; it primarily addresses political affiliation.

2. **Linkage to Evil or Conspiracy (Guidelines 2 and 4):** There is no mention of Jews being linked to evil forces, conspiracies, or control over societal institutions like governments or media, which are core themes in antisemitic rhetoric according to JDA.

3. **Words, Images, and Deeds (Guideline 3):** The tweet does not include derogatory words, visual stereotypes, or suggest any antisemitic actions against Jews.

4. **Coded Language (Guideline 4):** While the language of the tweet could be interpreted in various ways depending on one's political stance, it doesn't inherently convey a coded message about Jewish power or conspiracy that is characteristic of antisemitism as defined by JDA.

5. **Collective Responsibility and Political Pressure (Guidelines 7 and 8):** Although the tweet encourages Jews to consider supporting Republican candidates, it does not hold them collectively responsible for political decisions or require them to publicly condemn any other group. Encouraging a political choice is distinct from demanding a public condemnation of an identity group.

6. **Holocaust Denial (Guideline 5):** The tweet contains no denial or minimization of the Holocaust.

7. **Israel and Palestine Context (Guidelines B and C):** The tweet does not address Israel, Zionism, or Palestinian rights; thus, it falls outside the specific context where political views might intersect with antisemitic sentiments regarding these issues.

In summary, while the tweet encourages a particular political action among Jewish individuals, it lacks elements of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, the tweet is not antisemitic. It’s important to note that this analysis does not condone or encourage any form of partisanship that could be divisive; rather, it assesses whether the content fits within the specific parameters of antisemitism as defined by JDA.",1,0,1,0,0,0

The Muslim community must end this hatred, intolerance, and bigotry. \n\nhttps://t.co/4L7nrtEku6",Yes,"According to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, any expression that incites hatred toward Jews or portrays them in a mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical manner can be considered antisemitic. The tweet in question states that ""Incitement to the genocide of Jews is widespread inside mosques in the US,"" which directly aligns with one of the examples provided under the IHRA definition: calling for or aiding in the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.

The tweet suggests that incitement, which can be understood as instigation to commit harmful acts (including genocide) against Jewish people, is occurring within mosques. This not only portrays Muslims collectively in a negative and stereotypical light but also implies that such behavior is widespread, thus potentially dehumanizing and demonizing an entire religious community.

Furthermore, the tweet does not provide evidence for its claim and instead makes a sweeping generalization about a particular group's places of worship, which could reinforce existing antisemitic stereotypes. The call for the Muslim community to end this hatred may seem constructive, but the underlying assertion contributes to negative perceptions both against Jews (by perpetuating fear) and against Muslims (through collective blame).

Thus, given these considerations, the tweet fits within the framework of what can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it involves incitement and promotes harmful stereotypes about Jewish people.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is defined as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet in question accuses mosques in the US of spreading ""incitement to the genocide of Jews,"" suggesting a form of hostility that could be interpreted as antisemitic if directed specifically at individual Jews or Jewish communities without basis.

However, there are several important considerations:

1. **Generalization vs. Specificity**: The tweet makes a broad generalization about mosques in the US and their congregants. While this is problematic due to its sweeping nature, it does not target individuals because they are Jewish but rather criticizes a religious institution's actions or rhetoric.

2. **Contextual Evidence**: The JDA emphasizes context and evidence when determining if speech is antisemitic. Without additional context from the referenced material (link provided in the tweet), we cannot definitively assess whether there is credible evidence supporting the claim made about mosques promoting incitement to genocide.

3. **Nature of Criticism**: The tweet calls for an end to ""hatred, intolerance, and bigotry,"" which indicates a stance against perceived antisemitism rather than promoting it. This aligns more with addressing issues of prejudice rather than perpetuating them.

4. **Target of the Message**: The primary target here seems to be an alleged behavior within mosques, not Jewish people or institutions themselves. Thus, while the claim is serious and requires scrutiny, it doesn't directly fulfill the JDA's definition of antisemitism unless it can be shown that it was aimed at Jews specifically as a group.

In summary, although the tweet makes a significant accusation that could potentially incite hostility against Muslims if proven false or exaggerated, within the framework provided by the JDA, it does not constitute antisemitism as defined. The claim requires further investigation and evidence to substantiate such serious allegations but falls outside the specific definition of antisemitic behavior per the guidelines given.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Accusations of disloyalty have often preceded attacks/pograms against Jews.... https://t.co/q4NegxpRXu,Yes,"** According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, it is considered antisemitic when Jews are accused of being more loyal to Israel or Jewish interests than to their own nations. The tweet in question expresses outrage at Donald Trump's questioning of the loyalty of American Jews. This mirrors the example given in the IHRA definition where such accusations have often preceded attacks or pogroms against Jews.

The expression of concern about these loyalty accusations aligns with understanding how they can function as manifestations of antisemitism, particularly when they invoke historical stereotypes that Jewish people cannot be fully loyal to their country of residence due to supposed allegiance elsewhere. By highlighting the link between questioning Jewish loyalty and past violence or discrimination against Jews, the tweet underscores a contemporary form of antisemitic rhetoric as outlined by the IHRA.

Thus, while the tweet itself is an expression of outrage rather than direct incitement, it addresses the kind of narrative that fits within the framework of antisemitism as described by the IHRA definition.",No,"** The tweet expresses outrage at the questioning of American Jews' loyalty, which is a legitimate concern given historical contexts where such accusations have led to antisemitic actions. However, the tweet itself does not engage in discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions.

1. **Context and Content:** The tweet criticizes the act of questioning loyalty, suggesting it could lead to negative consequences based on historical patterns. This is a cautionary remark rather than an antisemitic statement. It highlights a potential risk without making any harmful generalizations about Jews themselves.

2. **Guideline Alignment:**
   - **Guideline 4** mentions that antisemitism can be direct or indirect, explicit or coded. The tweet does not engage in coded language against Jews but rather criticizes an action (questioning loyalty) for its potential consequences.
   - **Guideline 7 and 8** involve holding Jews collectively responsible or requiring them to condemn actions because of their Jewish identity. The tweet does not do this; it addresses the broader issue of questioning loyalty, which is a separate concern from collective responsibility or demands placed on Jews.

3. **Historical Awareness:** The reference to historical precedents where accusations of disloyalty have led to attacks against Jews shows an awareness of antisemitic patterns rather than perpetuating them. It serves as a warning about the dangers of such rhetoric.

It’s rare for Soviet Jews,who were let out of that socialist shithole &amp;into US on refugee visas thanks to ISRAEL’s influence,to not grasp it",Yes,"** The tweet contains several elements that align with the IHRA definition of antisemitism:

1. **Generalization and Stereotyping**: It uses derogatory language (""socialist shithole"") to describe the Soviet Union, which can be seen as dehumanizing, especially when discussing a place associated with Jewish identity for those emigrating from there. This stereotyping contributes to a negative perception of Jews who were part of this historical context.

2. **Double Standards and Collective Blame**: The tweet implies that all Soviet Jews have an inherent understanding or appreciation of Israel because they were ""let out... on refugee visas thanks to ISRAEL’s influence."" This suggests double standards by expecting a particular allegiance or gratitude towards Israel from Jewish individuals based solely on their background, rather than personal beliefs. It also implies collective responsibility and uniformity within the group.

3. **Negative Character Traits**: The language of the tweet might perpetuate negative stereotypes about Jews being expected to feel a certain way about Israel, which reflects an expectation tied to identity rather than individual choice or experience.

4. **Derogatory Language**: The use of highly offensive terms not only reflects poorly on the speaker but also contributes to a hostile environment for Jewish individuals discussing their backgrounds and personal connections to Israel.

Overall, while expressing a political opinion, the tweet crosses into antisemitic territory by employing stereotypical language, applying double standards, and making generalized assumptions about Soviet Jews' attitudes towards Israel.",No,"To determine if the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze it against the provided definition and guidelines.

1. **Definition of Antisemitism**: The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews because they are Jewish, or against Jewish institutions because they are Jewish. In this tweet, there is no direct expression of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence towards individuals who are Jewish or towards Jewish institutions.

2. **Guideline 7 (Collective Responsibility)**: One key area in the guidelines for Israel and Palestine-related content that can be antisemitic involves holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct. The tweet mentions U.S.-born Jews not understanding the importance of Israel, which could hint at collective responsibility. However, it does not explicitly accuse all American Jews of any wrongdoing or ascribe negative behavior to them because they are Jewish.

3. **Guideline 9 (Assuming Loyalty)**: This guideline concerns assuming that non-Israeli Jews are necessarily more loyal to Israel than their own countries. The tweet suggests that Soviet Jews understand the importance of Israel due to their history, but it does not make a negative assertion about American Jews’ loyalty or lack thereof.

4. **Criticisms and Context**: The tweet appears to express a personal viewpoint regarding differing perceptions of Israel's significance among Jewish communities based on geographic origin. It lacks derogatory language, harmful stereotypes, or any indication of hostility towards Jews as a group.

5. **Interpretation and Intent**: While some may find the sentiment expressed in the tweet contentious or disagreeable, it does not inherently violate the JDA guidelines. The tweet's context seems to be more about expressing an observation rather than promoting negative generalizations or stereotypes about American Jews.

In conclusion, while the tweet might reflect a divisive opinion on cultural differences within Jewish communities concerning Israel, it does not meet the threshold for antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It lacks the elements of prejudice, hostility, discrimination, or violence against Jews that characterize antisemitic actions and speech according to these guidelines.",1,0,1,0,0,0

While this phrasing is primarily directed at Islam, it's important to consider how the overall context and framing might contribute to antisemitic narratives as defined by the IHRA.

1. **Stereotyping**: The tweet implies a monolithic intent or agenda among Muslims against Christians, which can inadvertently reinforce harmful stereotypes about Muslim communities being inherently hostile towards other religions. This kind of stereotyping is related to how Jews have historically been stereotyped in antisemitic rhetoric as conspiratorial or collectively malign.

2. **Religious Conflict Framing**: The phrasing ""War Against Jesus"" could evoke imagery that aligns with classic antisemitic themes, particularly those involving religious conflict and blame. Historically, such narratives have included the portrayal of Jews as adversaries to Christianity, often using distorted historical events like the crucifixion.

3. **Linking Religious Groups with Conflict**: By framing Muslims in oppositional terms similar to those historically used against Jews (""war"" and ""against Jesus""), there's a risk of reinforcing divisive us-vs-them mentalities that have been exploited in antisemitic rhetoric. This can contribute to an environment where religious or ethnic groups are scapegoated for broader societal issues, akin to how Jews have often been blamed in various contexts.

4. **Potential Double Standards and Bias**: The tweet's emphasis on ""fighting radical Islam"" could suggest a double standard if similar scrutiny isn't applied uniformly across different groups that might also engage in extremist activities. This is reflective of the IHRA definition where antisemitism includes applying double standards to Israel or Jews that are not expected from other nations or peoples.

In conclusion, while the tweet does not explicitly target Jews, its framing aligns with some patterns seen in antisemitic rhetoric—such as promoting divisive stereotypes and using conflict-driven narratives. This can contribute to an environment where such biases flourish, thus meeting criteria under the IHRA definition of antisemitism when considering broader implications and contexts.",No,"The tweet in question mentions an imam working to build peace with Christians and Jews, which does not inherently contain any of the elements defined as antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

2. **Essentializing or Negative Generalizations about Jews**: The tweet does not make sweeping negative generalizations or essentialize characteristics of Jews. Instead, it suggests a cooperative effort towards peace between different religious groups.

3. **Linkage to Evil Forces**: There is no mention of linking Jews to forces of evil, nor any suggestion of Jewish conspiracy theories.

6. **Holocaust Denial or Minimization**: The tweet does not address the Holocaust, nor does it deny or minimize its occurrence.

7. **Israel and Palestine Context**: While the tweet mentions ""Jews,"" it is in a positive context of peacebuilding rather than discussing Israel or Palestinian issues that might be framed antisemitically.

By contrasting the treatment of Orthodox Jews in Israel with Palestinian protesters, the tweet suggests a greater or harsher scrutiny of Israeli actions against Jews compared to Palestinians without acknowledging any context or nuance. This kind of rhetoric can perpetuate negative stereotypes about the state of Israel's policies being inherently oppressive when it comes to its own citizens, which aligns with the IHRA definition where double standards are applied specifically to Israel.

Moreover, the tweet implies a sinister stereotype by suggesting that if such actions (e.g., shooting) occur against Palestinian protesters, they would be more egregious than what is shown in the video. This insinuates that Israeli forces might employ extreme violence universally but selectively reports or perceives this based on who is protesting, hinting at an inherent bias and malicious intent when it comes to Jewish citizens.

The comparison itself can be seen as antisemitic because it uses a contentious issue—treatment of protesters within Israel—to generalize about the state's actions towards its own people, contributing to a negative perception. This aligns with the IHRA examples where using double standards or drawing problematic comparisons contributes to an environment where Jews are portrayed in a negative light simply due to their connection to Israel.",No,"** 

The tweet in question describes an event where Israeli security forces are said to have ""brutally assaulted"" Orthodox Jewish protesters opposing compulsory military service, followed by a speculative remark about how Palestinians might be treated differently. To determine whether this constitutes antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must analyze it against the provided guidelines.

1. **Direct or Indirect Criticism of Israel:** The tweet criticizes Israeli security forces for their treatment of Jewish protesters. Under guideline 13, criticism of Israel as a state and its policies is not inherently antisemitic. The tweet makes an evidence-based critique about how Israeli authorities handle protests by different groups, which falls under legitimate political discourse.

2. **Racial or Group Stereotyping:** There are no racial stereotypes or generalizations about Jews in the tweet. It does not attribute any negative character traits to Jewish people as a whole but rather criticizes state action against specific individuals (Orthodox Jewish protesters).

3. **Comparison with Palestinian Treatment:** The tweet draws a comparison between how different groups might be treated by Israeli authorities, suggesting harsher treatment for Palestinians based on known historical and current events. This is not the same as applying negative stereotypes or symbols of classical antisemitism to Jews; rather, it's addressing perceived discrepancies in state actions.

4. **Instrumentalization or Conspiracy Theories:** There are no elements suggesting that Jews control Israel with a hidden agenda, nor any conspiracy theories about Jewish power or influence, which would fall under guidelines concerning coded language and imagery (guidelines 2 and 4).

5. **Collective Responsibility or Stigmatization of Jews:** The tweet does not hold all Jews collectively responsible for the actions of Israeli authorities, nor does it treat them as agents or representatives of Israel in a negative manner (as cautioned against in guideline 7). Instead, it specifically addresses an action taken by state security forces.

In conclusion, while some may find the language speculative or contentious, particularly concerning how Palestinians are perceived to be treated differently, this aspect alone does not meet the criteria for antisemitism according to JDA's definition and guidelines. The criticism is aimed at a government's actions rather than Jews as a people, and there is no evidence of racial generalizations, stereotypes, or conspiracy theories directed towards Jews themselves.

This assertion touches upon several key aspects outlined by the IHRA definition:

1. **Charging Jews with Responsibility or Ineffectiveness**: By suggesting that armed Jews could not have prevented the Holocaust, the tweet may imply an expectation for Jewish individuals to be able to resist or alter historical atrocities perpetrated against them. This aligns with the IHRA example of accusing Jews as a people of failing in situations where they were powerless.

2. **Stereotyping and Simplification**: The statement oversimplifies the complex circumstances surrounding resistance during the Holocaust, potentially reinforcing stereotypes that Jewish individuals should have been able to prevent such events single-handedly. This can be seen as perpetuating a narrative where Jews are unfairly blamed for historical tragedies in which they were victims.

3. **Ignoring Context and Historical Reality**: The tweet disregards the context of extreme oppression faced by Jewish communities during the Holocaust, where resistance was incredibly difficult due to severe restrictions and overwhelming Nazi power. By suggesting that armed action could have altered this outcome without considering these factors, it can be perceived as diminishing the historical reality and severity of the situation.

Overall, while the intention may not have been antisemitic, the language used in the tweet aligns with elements of the IHRA definition regarding how Jews are portrayed or blamed for historical events beyond their control. Therefore, within this context, the tweet could reasonably be considered as antisemitic.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze it against the provided definition and guidelines.

1. **Definition**: The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews because they are Jewish, or against Jewish institutions for being Jewish. The tweet does not express any form of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence towards Jews or Jewish institutions simply on the basis that they are Jewish.

2. **Guideline A.4**: This guideline discusses antisemitism as potentially direct or indirect and coded, with examples relating to stereotypical claims about Jewish power or influence. The tweet in question does not make any generalized negative statements about Jewish people's inherent characteristics, nor does it suggest Jews possess hidden powers or are universally responsible for historical events like the Holocaust.

3. **Guideline B**: These guidelines address how Israel and Palestine-related discussions could be antisemitic by associating modern Jewish state actions with classical antisemitic stereotypes. The tweet neither applies these symbols to Israel nor holds all Jews collectively responsible for any aspect of Israeli conduct.

4. **Context and Content**: The tweet criticizes a statement made by Shannon Watts regarding armed Jews during the Holocaust, pointing out that some Jews did resist and were successful. This is an evidence-based correction aimed at historical accuracy rather than a blanket generalization or stereotype about Jewish people as a group. It does not imply any inherent negative traits among Jews but instead challenges a specific claim.

Oh &amp; you jumped onto my timeline to abuse , strange lady",Yes,"The tweet implies that Lizzy M. Howard is engaging in antisemitic behavior by allegedly attacking an individual who is defending UK Jews, suggesting a narrative where she may be aligned with those posing a danger to Jewish communities. This aligns with the IHRA definition's examples of antisemitism when it involves holding Jews collectively responsible for actions perceived as threatening or harmful, particularly if these perceptions are unfounded or exaggerated.

While the tweet does not explicitly use language directly from the IHRA definition such as conspiracy theories about global Jewish control or denial of the Holocaust, it implies a divisive stance that portrays one party as protecting Jews and another (in this case, Howard) as potentially threatening them. This can perpetuate harmful stereotypes by insinuating that certain individuals or groups are inherently aligned against Jewish interests.

Furthermore, by framing herself as standing with a ""minority under attack,"" the author of the tweet may be indirectly invoking antisemitic tropes that depict Jews either as oppressors (the minority being attacked) or as requiring protection from external threats (implying an inherent vulnerability). This could also reflect a double standard, where defending Jews against perceived threats is seen as more legitimate than critiquing other groups.

In summary, the tweet can be considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition due to its implication of collective responsibility and alignment with harmful narratives about Jewish vulnerability and external threat.",No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly or implicitly meet the criteria outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) for antisemitic content. 

1. **Targeting Individuals**: The tweet mentions ""Corbyn"" and refers to a perceived threat he poses to UK Jews, but it does not make any negative generalizations about Jewish people as a whole or attribute harmful stereotypes to them.

2. **Essentializing or Generalizing**: There is no evidence of essentializing Jewish traits or making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews in the tweet. It focuses on a specific political figure and situation without linking Jews collectively to negative traits or actions.

3. **Linkage to Evil or Conspiracy**: The tweet does not suggest that Jews are linked to evil forces, nor does it imply any conspiracy theories involving Jewish people controlling governments, media, banks, etc.

4. **Direct or Indirect Hostility**: While the language used in the tweet might be contentious or politically charged, it does not express direct or indirect hostility towards Jews as a group. It criticizes Corbyn's stance without attributing negative actions to Jewish individuals collectively.

5. **Coded Language**: The tweet does not employ coded language that would imply antisemitic sentiments under the JDA guidelines. There is no mention of hidden agendas, power manipulation, or racializing language connected to Jews.

6. **Criticism vs. Antisemitism**: Criticizing a political figure like Corbyn for his stance on issues affecting UK Jews does not inherently equate to antisemitism. The tweet expresses support for those it perceives as under attack, without blaming Jewish individuals or communities for the situation.

In other words, it's bollox! #JC4PM",Yes,"**

The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition due to several reasons:

1. **Dismissal of Concerns:** The tweet dismisses the concerns of a significant portion of the Jewish community about allegations of antisemitism by trivializing their experiences and perceptions as ""bollox"" (a derogatory term). This undermines legitimate fears regarding antisemitism and can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize their voice, similar to historical patterns of denying or minimizing the experiences of Jews.

2. **Mocking Fear:** The tweet mocks the idea that British Jews might consider emigrating if Jeremy Corbyn became Prime Minister due to perceived antisemitism. This can contribute to a harmful narrative that questions the legitimacy of Jewish fears and concerns about their safety, which aligns with historical stereotypes that accuse Jews of being overly sensitive or exaggerated in their responses.

3. **Questioning Validity of Statistics:** By focusing on the small sample size (0.28%) used for the statistics without acknowledging the broader context of widespread concern among British Jews regarding antisemitism and Jeremy Corbyn's alleged attitudes, the tweet can contribute to dismissing genuine concerns as unfounded or exaggerated. This aligns with the IHRA examples that include making mendacious or dehumanizing allegations about Jews.

4. **Potential Impact:** While not explicitly using classical antisemitic tropes like conspiracy theories or Holocaust denial, the dismissive tone and implication that Jewish people's concerns are baseless can contribute to an environment where antisemitism is tolerated or ignored. This aligns with the IHRA definition’s emphasis on rhetorical manifestations of antisemitism.

In summary, while not overtly using traditional antisemitic language, the tweet embodies a dismissive attitude toward Jewish concerns about antisemitism, which aligns with the patterns described in the IHRA working definition, particularly concerning dismissing or mocking legitimate fears and experiences.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet in question criticizes the methodology of a survey regarding British Jews' perceptions of Jeremy Corbyn and suggests skepticism about its findings due to the small sample size. 

The tweet does not engage with any stereotypes, negative imagery, or actions that could be considered antisemitic under the JDA guidelines. Specifically:

1. **Absence of Stereotyping**: The tweet does not use essentializing language or generalizations about Jews as a group.

2. **No Linkage to Evil or Conspiracy**: It doesn’t suggest any conspiracy theories involving Jews or link them with negative forces, which is a core aspect of classic antisemitism according to the JDA.

3. **No Hostility or Violence**: There are no hostile words, images, or suggested actions against Jewish people or institutions.

4. **Criticism Contextualized**: The critique seems focused on survey methodology and does not express hostility towards Jews but rather skepticism about a specific claim's validity.

5. **Political Speech and Critique**: The tweet could be interpreted as part of political discourse regarding public figures and their views, which is protected under free speech norms unless it crosses into antisemitism by attacking Jews specifically or using coded language to do so.

The Torah and other texts say it over and over and over again. You don’t have to believe in the Torah! But denying Jewish peoplehood just makes you look ignorant.",Yes,"** The tweet can be interpreted as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition due to several factors:

1. **Denial of Jewish Peoplehood**: The tweet implies that recognizing Jews as a nation is equivalent to endorsing Nazism, which can be seen as denying Jewish peoplehood. This aligns with an example in the IHRA definition that involves denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination.

2. **Equating Judaism with Nazism**: By suggesting that calling Jews a nation makes one ""literally Hitler,"" the tweet draws a comparison between Jewish identity and Nazi ideology, which is akin to applying classic antisemitic symbols and images inappropriately.

3. **Mocking Religious Texts**: The statement mockingly references religious texts (the Torah) as promoting Nazism, which could be seen as dehumanizing or demonizing Jews by associating their religion with an extremist regime responsible for genocide.

4. **Overall Context and Perception**: Although the tweet might be intended as a critique of identity politics or nationalism, its language can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misconceptions about Jewish identity, aligning with manifestations that blame Jews collectively for broader ideological stances.

Considering these points, the tweet's content and implications align with several examples of antisemitism outlined by the IHRA definition.",No,"**

The tweet in question asserts that labeling Jews as a nation is akin to making an analogy with Hitler, and suggests that this comparison equates Judaism itself to Hitler. The author argues against denying Jewish peoplehood, emphasizing the importance of recognizing Jews as a distinct group without necessarily endorsing religious beliefs.

Analyzing this statement under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines:

1. **Essentializing or Negative Generalizations (Guideline A.1):** The tweet does not essentialize Jews by attributing negative inherent traits to them but rather criticizes a comparison that could be considered disrespectful or historically insensitive.

2. **Linkage to Evil or Conspiracy (Guideline A.2):** There is no mention of linking Jews to evil, conspiracy, or hidden power in the tweet. The focus is on the idea of Jewish peoplehood, not any negative stereotyping associated with classic antisemitism.

3. **Manifestation in Words/Deeds (Guideline A.3):** While strong language is used, it does not directly manifest as discriminatory, prejudiced, hostile, or violent against Jews or Jewish institutions as such.

4. **Coded Speech (Guideline A.4):** The tweet does not employ coded language that might suggest underlying antisemitic sentiments. It addresses a specific point of view and rebukes it without invoking antisemitic stereotypes.

5. **Holocaust Denial (Guideline A.5):** There is no denial or minimization of the Holocaust in this statement, so this guideline is not applicable.

Regarding sections B and C concerning Israel and Palestine:

- The tweet does not address any issues specific to Israel’s policies, Zionism, or its relations with Palestinians. Therefore, it falls outside these considerations.

In summary, while the tweet uses strong language, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as outlined by the JDA. It criticizes a particular comparison without demonizing Jews as a group or attributing negative inherent characteristics to them. Thus, according to the guidelines provided by the JDA, the tweet is not antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

This can be seen as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition for several reasons:

1. **Historical Context**: Martin Luther, initially a reformer within Christianity, later wrote vehemently against Jews in his treatise ""On the Jews and Their Lies."" His writings included many negative stereotypes and calls for harsh treatment of Jewish people, which have been used historically to justify antisemitic attitudes and actions.

2. **Stereotyping and Demonization**: By invoking Luther's views without context, there is a risk of perpetuating the stereotype that Jewish people are inherently problematic or malevolent, aligning with the IHRA definition's mention of ""mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews.""

3. **Implication of Conspiracy and Harm**: The question implies that Luther’s writings might contain truths about Jews conspiring to harm others or being responsible for broader societal issues (""have people *read* what Martin Luther said about Jews?""), which resonates with the IHRA definition's reference to charges against Jews as a collective conspiracy.

4. **Perpetuating Harmful Narratives**: While historical context is important, referencing such views without explicitly condemning them can perpetuate harmful narratives and stereotypes that contribute to contemporary antisemitism.

Therefore, although the tweet does not directly express hatred or call for harm, it aligns with patterns of thought that are recognized as antisemitic under the IHRA definition by potentially reinforcing negative stereotypes and demonizing Jewish people.",No,"** The tweet in question asks if people have read what Martin Luther said about Jews, which does not inherently contain any elements of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. Based on the guidelines provided by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), several factors must be considered:

1. **Context and Intent:** The tweet appears to prompt a discussion about historical views rather than expressing direct antisemitic sentiment itself. It does not make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews or attribute any form of inherent evil to them.

2. **Instrumentalization for Harmful Ends:** There is no indication that the tweet uses Luther's statements as part of modern anti-Jewish fantasies, such as linking Jews with control over governments, media, or other conspiratorial ideas outlined in guideline 2.

3. **Manifestation through Words:** The tweet does not use words to spread stereotypes or hatred about Jews; it merely references historical texts for discussion.

4. **Coded Language or Denial of History:** There is no indication that the tweet employs coded language against Jews, nor does it deny or minimize the Holocaust as outlined in guideline 5.

While Martin Luther's writings have been historically used to justify antisemitic views and actions, the mere mention of them for historical reading or discussion in this context does not constitute antisemitism according to the JDA. The tweet lacks any direct, indirect, explicit, or coded hostility towards Jews as a group, nor does it attribute evil motives or conspiracy theories to them.

The tweet in question makes an assertion that certain ""anti-racists"" were willing to disregard or even harm Jewish individuals (""throw Jews under the bus"") for their own ideological or tribal reasons. This statement implies a negative stereotype about anti-racism efforts and suggests that these groups are willing to target Jews, either directly or indirectly.

According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, antisemitic acts can include expressions that suggest Jews are targeted or discriminated against within broader movements or ideologies, including those related to anti-racism. The tweet could be seen as suggesting a conspiratorial stance, where Jewish people are portrayed as being treated unfairly by other groups due to their identity alone.

Additionally, the use of ""tribalism"" can evoke notions of insular group loyalty that may marginalize others, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes about Jews and their perceived allegiances or treatment within larger societal frameworks. This could be interpreted as reinforcing a divisive perception between Jewish individuals and other communities, potentially contributing to an environment where Jews are viewed suspiciously.

In the context provided by the IHRA definition, this tweet can be considered antisemitic because it implies that Jewish people might face hostility or discrimination from groups claiming to oppose racism, which can feed into harmful stereotypes about Jewish collective identity and experiences. This interpretation fits within examples of contemporary antisemitism where Jews are accused of being unfairly targeted within societal debates or movements.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, we need to analyze its content based on the provided definition and examples.

1. **Definition Analysis**: The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). The tweet in question mentions ""these 'anti-racists'"" being happy to ""throw Jews under the bus."" This implies a criticism of certain individuals' actions perceived as neglecting or betraying Jewish interests.

2. **Guideline A - General**: 
   - The tweet does not essentialize Jews by attributing inherent negative traits; rather, it accuses others (""anti-racists"") of failing to support Jewish interests.
   - There is no suggestion that Jews are linked to forces of evil or possess hidden power for a malevolent collective agenda. Instead, the focus is on actions perceived as unfair towards Jews.

3. **Guideline A - Manifestations**: 
   - The tweet uses words to express dissatisfaction with how some anti-racist individuals may have treated Jewish interests, but it does not use hostile language directed at Jews themselves.
   - It does not depict Jews in a derogatory manner or imply negative stereotypes about them.

4. **Guideline B - Israel and Palestine**: 
   - The tweet does not specifically relate to the State of Israel or Palestinian demands; rather, it focuses on broader accusations against certain anti-racist behaviors towards Jews.

5. **Contextual Interpretation**:
   - The criticism seems directed at specific actions by some individuals within a political context (""anti-racists""), suggesting that they may have neglected Jewish concerns in favor of other tribal priorities.
   - This accusation does not inherently imply antisemitic views but rather points to perceived hypocrisy or lack of solidarity from certain groups with Jewish interests.

Based on these considerations, the tweet appears to be an expression of frustration towards specific individuals' actions regarding Jewish issues and not directed against Jews as a group. Therefore, it is not classified as antisemitic according to the JDA definition.

Sub USA for Jerusalem:\n""but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem""",Yes,"The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition due to its potential implications and context, even if it does not explicitly state antisemitic content. Here’s a breakdown of how this conclusion is reached:

1. **Interpretation of Historical Context**: The reference to Nehemiah and the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls involves historical events tied closely with Jewish history. By invoking this narrative in a contemporary religious or political dispute, there could be an implicit attempt to draw on negative stereotypes or themes historically used against Jews.

2. **Implied Comparison and Allegory**: The tweet prompts readers to consider whether the actions described in Nehemiah are analogous to modern figures or entities (e.g., the Pope, USA), suggesting a kind of exclusion similar to what Jewish people experienced historically with ""no portion, nor right, nor memorial."" This comparison can be interpreted as drawing on antisemitic themes by implying that Jews or their allegiances inherently sow division or fear.

3. **Use of Biblical Texts for Modern Political Allegory**: While biblical references themselves are not necessarily antisemitic, using them to draw comparisons between Jewish historical figures and contemporary non-Jewish entities in a way that implies negative traits (such as sowing division) can perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

4. **Targeting Contemporary Jewish Identity or Institutions**: By substituting ""Jerusalem"" with another geopolitical entity (USA) and possibly implying criticism of religious leadership (Pope), the tweet might indirectly target Jewish identity or institutions by using their historical narrative for a contemporary political purpose.

5. **Stereotypes and Conspiratorial Overtones**: The suggestion that adherence to certain beliefs or actions inherently causes division can echo antisemitic stereotypes, particularly if one reads into it an insinuation about Jewish conspiracies or dual loyalties (historically, accusations of Jews being disloyal).

Thus, the tweet employs historical religious narrative in a way that could resonate with harmful stereotypes and negative character traits associated with Jews. Even without explicit hate speech, its implications can align with the IHRA definition's examples of antisemitic manifestations by indirectly employing these themes.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition, we need to assess if it involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish).

1. **Content Analysis**: The tweet references a biblical story about Nehemiah and the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls, posing questions about whether their actions were divisive or fearful.

2. **Historical Context**: The referenced passage (Nehemiah 2:12-20) is part of an ancient narrative involving the Jewish people’s return from exile and efforts to rebuild their city, which faced opposition. This context is historical and religious rather than political or contemporary in nature.

3. **Interpretation**: The tweet appears to be engaging with a biblical story for rhetorical purposes rather than making any direct statement against Jews as a group today. It uses an analogy (substituting ""Jerusalem"" for ""USA"") but does not attribute negative characteristics to Jews, Jewish institutions, or contemporary Jewish communities.

4. **Linkage to Evil**: The tweet does not suggest that Jews are linked to evil forces or possess hidden power in modern contexts, which is a key aspect of classic antisemitism as outlined in the JDA guidelines.

5. **Contemporary Relevance**: There is no indication that this historical analogy directly targets contemporary Jewish people or implies harmful stereotypes about them. It does not engage with current politics or social issues involving Jews as individuals or communities today.

6. **Potential Misinterpretation**: While some might interpret the rhetorical substitution in a contentious way, particularly if they view it as implicating religious figures like the Pope negatively, this interpretation does not inherently carry antisemitic connotations under the JDA's definition unless further context explicitly ties it to hostility against Jews themselves.

In summary, the tweet focuses on a historical and biblical narrative without making direct or indirect claims about contemporary Jewish people or institutions. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Someone posted on Facebook and strangers just showing up https://t.co/wVYLDqwgYT,Yes,"According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, manifestations include actions or rhetoric that target Jews due to their religious identity, often using harmful stereotypes. The tweet in question describes a scenario where Jewish individuals are gathering outside a mosque during prayer times, which could be perceived as an act targeting Muslim worshippers based on a stereotypical association between Muslims and hostility towards Jews. This action can create an atmosphere of intimidation or threat directed at the Muslim community, reflecting negative stereotypes that associate Jews with aggression against Muslims.

Moreover, the context in which the tweet was written suggests an intent to provoke or alarm by highlighting the presence of ""strangers"" (implying outsiders or possibly antagonists) showing up at a mosque. This could be interpreted as applying double standards or creating fear based on religious identity, fitting within the IHRA's examples of antisemitic behavior when such actions are driven by prejudicial views against Jews.

While the tweet does not explicitly contain language that matches all elements of the IHRA definition, its implicit message—particularly if it reflects underlying biases or encourages hostility towards Muslims—can contribute to an environment of inter-community tension and discrimination. The potential for harm and the perpetuation of negative stereotypes mean this action could be considered antisemitic under the IHRA guidelines.",No,"The tweet mentions ""DC Jews just appearing outside downtown mosque at midday prayer"" and suggests that this is due to a post on Facebook. Based on the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, several key points should be considered:

1. **Content Analysis**: The tweet itself does not include explicit negative generalizations or stereotypes about Jews as outlined in Guideline 2 of the JDA. There are no references to Jews being linked with evil, possessing hidden power, or any other classical antisemitic trope.

2. **Context and Intent**: Without additional context indicating that these individuals were engaging in hostile actions against Muslims at the mosque (such as protesting or harassment), the tweet seems more neutral in nature. It simply reports an observation of people showing up at a location based on information shared online.

3. **Indirect Implications**: The tweet could potentially be interpreted as suggesting suspicious behavior, but it does not inherently convey discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews (or Jewish institutions) as Jews. There is no evidence in the text that implies harmful intent toward Jews as a group.

4. **Guidelines Consideration**: According to the JDA guidelines under section A and B, antisemitism involves specific types of actions or statements about Jews collectively, often involving stereotypes or conspiracy theories. The tweet does not fulfill these criteria; it lacks any essentializing, stereotyping, or attributing negative traits inherently linked to Jews.

5. **Potential for Misinterpretation**: While some might find the content of the tweet concerning or suspicious if they interpret ""showing up"" as potentially hostile, this alone does not satisfy the JDA's definition of antisemitism without further evidence indicating intent or action that targets Jews negatively.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the tweet and applying the guidelines from the JDA, the content is not inherently antisemitic.

The tweet in question claims that ""revisionism"" entirely denies the slaughter of Jews at the hands of Palestinian Arabs during the time period when this violence occurred, particularly highlighting the involvement and support of Hitler.

1. **Holocaust Denial/Minimization:** The tweet implicitly suggests that acknowledgment is required only for Jewish suffering under National Socialist Germany while denying or minimizing other instances of persecution, such as those perpetrated by Arab groups. This can be seen as an attempt to deny or distort parts of the historical record related to Jewish suffering during World War II.

2. **Double Standards and Decontextualization:** By emphasizing Jewish victimhood only in the context of Nazi Germany and seemingly downplaying or dismissing violence against Jews from other sources, there is a potential application of double standards—a recognized antisemitic trope according to the IHRA definition. It implies that acknowledging any suffering outside this narrow context invalidates legitimate recognition of Holocaust atrocities.

3. **Accusation of Conspiracies:** Although not explicit in this tweet, attributing such violence solely or predominantly to Hitler and his influence could be seen as part of a broader narrative that suggests Jewish victimhood is exclusively due to external conspiratorial forces (e.g., Nazism), thereby ignoring other complexities.

Given these points, the tweet aligns with aspects of Holocaust denial/distortion as outlined in the IHRA definition and thus can be considered antisemitic. It minimizes or denies historical realities outside the specific context of Nazi persecution without acknowledging the full scope of Jewish suffering during that period.",No,"** To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must analyze it against the definition and guidelines provided.

1. **Definition of Antisemitism in JDA**: The primary definition states that antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish. 

2. **Guideline 5** relates to Holocaust denial, which is explicitly classified as antisemitic if it denies the deliberate Nazi genocide of Jews.

3. In this tweet, the author references ""revisionism"" that allegedly denies the slaughter of Jews at the hands of Palestinian Arabs during a historical context linked with Hitler's support. This suggests an acknowledgment of Jewish suffering and victimization, albeit in a specific historical scenario involving Palestinians rather than Nazis directly.

4. **Application to JDA Guidelines**:
   - The tweet does not deny or minimize the Holocaust itself (Nazi genocide of Jews), which would align it with antisemitic behavior under Guideline 5.
   - Instead, it criticizes revisionism that allegedly denies Jewish suffering during a particular period (World War II) at the hands of others supported by Hitler, but doesn't deny the broader context of the Holocaust. 
   - There is no indication in the tweet of essentializing Jews as inherently negative or linking them to forces of evil, which would be required for classification under guidelines 1 and 2.

5. **Conclusion**: The content of the tweet does not meet the criteria of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews, nor does it engage in Holocaust denial per the JDA's definition of antisemitism. It appears to argue against a specific form of historical revisionism rather than engaging in antisemitic conduct or rhetoric.

This situation aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes calling for or aiding in harming Jews due to radical ideology or extremist views, including those linked to racial superiority or supremacy.

The perpetrator's explicit description of his ""hate for Jews"" directly reflects a perception and expression of hatred towards Jewish individuals. Furthermore, urging fellow white supremacists to carry out similar attacks indicates an intent to perpetuate violence against Jews, aligning with the IHRA's examples of antisemitic manifestations such as targeting Jewish communities or institutions.

While the tweet itself does not contain antisemitic content directly from its author, it reports on acts that are clearly motivated by antisemitism according to the IHRA definition. Therefore, in this context, the described events are considered antisemitic because they involve violence against Jews inspired by racial and religious hatred.",No,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is defined as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews because they are Jewish. The tweet describes a criminal act by an individual who was motivated by hate for Jews and others, identifying him as a white supremacist inspired by another extremist figure known for committing acts of terror targeting specific groups.

The tweet itself does not exhibit antisemitic characteristics according to the JDA guidelines:

1. **Content of the Tweet:** The tweet is reporting on an incident where a shooter targeted a synagogue due to his anti-Jewish sentiments. It conveys factual information about the shooter's motivations and actions, aiming to inform rather than express or propagate antisemitism.

2. **Purpose and Context:** The primary purpose of the tweet appears to be informing the public about a violent hate crime against Jews. By highlighting the perpetrator’s motives rooted in white supremacist ideology, it aims to shed light on issues of antisemitic violence and extremism rather than perpetuate them.

3. **Alignment with JDA Guidelines:** 
   - The tweet does not essentialize or make general negative statements about Jewish people as a whole.
   - It does not apply classical antisemitic stereotypes or symbols to Jews or Israel, nor does it hold Jews collectively responsible for any actions unrelated to their own behavior.
   - There is no evidence of denial or minimization of the Holocaust in the tweet.

Overall, while the event described in the tweet is undeniably rooted in antisemitism due to the shooter's motivations and actions, the content of the tweet itself does not align with the JDA's definition of antisemitic speech.

According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, one manifestation includes making mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews, such as the claim that Jews are responsible for killing Jesus—a classic example of using historical stereotypes to vilify Jewish people.

The tweet's analogy suggests a parallel between contemporary accusations against Representative Ilhan Omar and longstanding antisemitic rhetoric. By highlighting this comparison, the tweet acknowledges the use of historical antisemitic tropes in modern political discourse. The reference to ""Omar = 9/11"" being similar to ""Jews killed Jesus"" fits within the IHRA's framework as it involves using a harmful stereotype with deep roots in antisemitism.

Furthermore, the broader context provided by the tweet—emphasizing that such comparisons are bigoted and urging awareness of this form of bigotry—supports the idea that recognizing these patterns is important to combatting antisemitic rhetoric. The call for reflection on how similar historical prejudices have been used against Jewish people underscores the recognition of these statements as part of a broader antisemitic discourse.

Thus, by drawing attention to how current accusations mirror historical antisemitic stereotypes and calling out their bigotry, the tweet aligns with examples provided in the IHRA definition that illustrate manifestations of antisemitism.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must analyze it based on the definition and guidelines provided.

1. **Definition Context**: The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). The tweet does not target Jews explicitly; instead, it criticizes a comparison made between Rep. Ilhan Omar and the 9/11 attacks by suggesting that such comparisons are bigoted.

2. **Guideline Analysis**:
   - **General Guidelines**: The tweet mentions ""Jews killed Jesus,"" which is recognized as an antisemitic trope that has historically been used to dehumanize Jewish people. However, in this context, the tweet uses this phrase not to promote or validate it but to draw a parallel with other harmful comparisons and highlight their bigotry.
   - **Guideline 4 (Coded Language)**: The tweet might be seen as using historical antisemitic rhetoric to make a point about discrimination against another group (in this case, potentially Muslims). While mentioning ""Jews killed Jesus"" could be controversial or offensive to some, the intent here is not to promote antisemitism but rather to criticize bigotry in general.
   - **Context and Intent**: The tweet appears to express solidarity with Ilhan Omar (""#IStandWithIlhanOmar"") by highlighting perceived bigotry against her. It does not make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews or portray them as linked to evil forces. Instead, it critiques the use of historical antisemitic tropes for making harmful comparisons.

3. **JDA on Israel and Palestine**: The guidelines primarily address how speech concerning Israel can be antisemitic. This tweet does not engage with issues specifically related to Israel or Zionism in a manner that could invoke those particular guidelines.

In summary, while the tweet uses a historically antisemitic trope to illustrate its point about bigotry, it is framed as a criticism of such tactics rather than an endorsement of them. The context and intent suggest the goal is to condemn harmful comparisons, not to perpetuate antisemitism. Therefore, according to the JDA's definition and guidelines, this tweet would be considered non-antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Here are key reasons why this tweet can be considered antisemitic:

1. **Stereotyping and Demonization**: The tweet implies a negative stereotype about Jews by suggesting that some left-wing Jews are ""ready to work with a far-right party led by a former neo-Nazi."" This insinuates duplicity or moral compromise, feeding into the narrative of sinister character traits often associated with antisemitic rhetoric.

2. **Collective Blame**: By singling out ""some left-wing Jews"" as being ready to collaborate with an extreme right-wing party, it unfairly places collective blame on Jewish individuals for engaging in politically controversial actions. This aligns with the IHRA definition’s point about accusing Jews of wrongdoing based on the actions of a few.

3. **Conspiracy and Distrust**: The tweet subtly suggests a conspiracy or hidden agenda by implying that these left-wing Jews have an ulterior motive in collaborating with a far-right party, which can be seen as echoing themes of distrust often found in antisemitic narratives.

While it's important to consider context, such as the broader discussion surrounding political alliances and actions, this tweet predominantly reflects stereotypes and blame directed at Jewish individuals based on their political choices. Therefore, under the IHRA definition, it can be considered an expression of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question states, ""In Hungary, some left-wing Jews are ready to work with a far-right party led by a former neo-Nazi."" To determine whether this statement is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to evaluate it against the provided guidelines.

1. **General Guidelines**:
   - The tweet does not essentialize or make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews as a group, so guideline 1 is not violated.
   - There is no mention of Jews being linked to evil forces, conspiracy theories, hidden power, control over governments, banks, media, or any other classical antisemitic stereotype. Thus, guideline 2 does not apply.

2. **Manifestations of Antisemitism**:
   - The tweet does not include derogatory words about Jews (such as being inherently stingy or wealthy), nor does it involve visual antisemitic stereotypes. Therefore, guideline 3 is not applicable.
   - There is no coded language suggesting that ""Jews"" collectively possess hidden power or control, so guideline 4 is irrelevant.

3. **Specific Context of Israel and Palestine**:
   - The tweet does not reference Israel or Zionism in a way that applies negative stereotypes or holds Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel. Therefore, guidelines 6 through 10 are not pertinent.

Overall, the content of the tweet is a factual statement about political alignment without invoking antisemitic stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or collective blame against Jews. It does not express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence towards Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish, which is required by the JDA definition for something to be considered antisemitic.

EXPLICATION:

The tweet in question references statements allegedly made by Hamas that include explicit calls to stop antisemitic rhetoric and actions, such as flying swastikas (a symbol historically associated with Nazi persecution of Jews), saying Jews cause AIDS (which is a mendacious and dehumanizing stereotype about Jews), and inciting violence against Jews globally.

According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism:

1. **Manifestations Including Harm or Violence**: The tweet acknowledges Hamas's calls for cessation of actions that would directly harm Jewish individuals, such as encouraging public swastika displays and promoting violence against Jews.
   
2. **Mendacious Allegations and Stereotypes**: Mentioning the false claim that ""Jews cause AIDS"" falls under making mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews.

3. **Incitement to Violence**: The reference to inciting the murder of Jews fits with antisemitism being expressed as calls for harm toward Jewish individuals based on their identity.

The tweet highlights these antisemitic behaviors attributed to Hamas, thereby acknowledging their existence and potential impact on public perception, which aligns with recognizing actions that qualify as antisemitic under the IHRA definition. Therefore, by pointing out these antisemitic elements in Hamas's statements, the tweet itself reflects a discussion or acknowledgment of antisemitism according to the IHRA criteria.

Furthermore, although the tweet is framed critically—pointing out how such behaviors harm Hamas's image—it still communicates instances that meet the IHRA’s criteria for antisemitism by documenting actions and rhetoric aimed at Jews in harmful ways. Thus, considering these points, it can be determined that the content of the tweet aligns with what is recognized as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",No,"**

To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to examine its content against the provided definition and guidelines.

1. **Content of the Tweet:**
   - The tweet reports statements attributed to Hamas, a Palestinian political organization. It mentions three separate calls by Hamas:
     1. Stop flying swastikas in public.
     2. Stop saying Jews cause AIDS in public.
     3. Stop calling on Palestinians globally to murder Jews where they see them.

   - The tweet concludes with the statement: ""It harms their image.""

2. **Analysis Against JDA Guidelines:**
   - **Guideline A (General)**: 
     - There is no direct expression of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews in this tweet itself.
     - It does not essentialize Jewish traits, nor does it make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews.

   - **Guideline B (Israel and Palestine: examples that are antisemitic)**:
     - The tweet does not apply symbols, images, or negative stereotypes of classical antisemitism to Israel. Instead, it highlights problematic statements made by Hamas.
     - It does not hold all Jews collectively responsible for any actions or imply that Jewish individuals should publicly condemn Zionism.

   - **Guideline C (Israel and Palestine: examples that are not antisemitic)**:
     - The tweet can be seen as a critique of the actions or statements of Hamas, which is in line with supporting evidence-based criticism without targeting Jews globally.
     - It does not deny the right of Jews to exist; rather, it highlights actions perceived as harmful by another group (Hamas).

3. **Context and Intent:**
   - The tweet focuses on reporting problematic behaviors attributed to a specific organization (Hamas) regarding its public statements about Jews. The intent appears to be highlighting these issues rather than promoting antisemitic views.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the JDA guidelines, the tweet does not exhibit characteristics of antisemitism as it neither discriminates against nor attributes negative stereotypes or violence towards Jews globally. Instead, it criticizes certain statements made by Hamas. Therefore, according to the JDA definition, this tweet is not antisemitic.

By applying these criteria from the JDA, we conclude that the tweet itself does not meet the threshold for being considered antisemitic under its guidelines.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Jews."" According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, such a statement can be interpreted as part of ""making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such,"" which is one of the manifestations listed. 

Moreover, while it's important not to conflate criticism of Israel with antisemitism, the tweet suggests that this hate extends to Israel (""hate for... Israel""), possibly implying a double standard by associating Jewish identity with political entities like Israel and then criticizing them collectively. This can be interpreted as ""applying double standards by requiring of it [Israel] a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation,"" which is also mentioned in the IHRA examples.

Furthermore, expressing hate for Jews alongside support for nations traditionally viewed negatively in Western contexts (Venezuela, Russia, Iran) may suggest a broader conspiratorial viewpoint that aligns with antisemitic stereotypes. While the tweet does not explicitly state all elements of the IHRA definition, its implication of generalized hatred towards Jews and possibly associating them with negative actions or entities fits within the framework of antisemitism as outlined by the IHRA.",No,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition and guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence specifically against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet in question states that ""The Labour party is so full of hate now... Hate for Tories, Jews, Israel, Blairites, Brownites, America, the West in general... Whilst a love for Venezuela, Russia, Iran & Palestine."" While it mentions ""hate for Jews,"" this does not inherently mean antisemitism unless there are specific manifestations or expressions that align with the JDA's criteria.

1. **General Context:** The tweet lists multiple groups alongside Jews (such as Tories and Blairites), without providing evidence of hostility directed specifically at Jewish individuals or institutions due to their identity, rather than political alignment or other factors. This can imply generalized discontent with the Labour party rather than antisemitism.

2. **Israel and Palestine Clause:** The JDA distinguishes between criticism or support for Palestinians, which is not inherently antisemitic (Guideline 11), and actions or statements that apply classical antisemitic stereotypes to Israel or hold Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct (Guidelines 6-10). The tweet expresses ""love"" for Palestine but does not mention Israel in a way that would invoke the negative stereotypes outlined.

3. **Lack of Specificity:** There are no specific antisemitic actions, symbols, or images mentioned against Jews or Jewish institutions. The use of terms like ""hate"" in this context can reflect political dissatisfaction rather than antisemitism unless explicitly directed at Jews solely for their Jewish identity (Guideline 7).

4. **Political Critique vs. Antisemitism:** The JDA allows for criticism of Israel as a state and its policies without it being automatically categorized as antisemitic, provided these criticisms are evidence-based and do not rely on stereotypes or conspiracy theories about Jews globally (Guidelines 13-14). This tweet does not engage in specific anti-Israel rhetoric that would meet the criteria for antisemitism under those guidelines.

In summary, while the tweet is critical and hostile towards several groups including Jews, it lacks specific indicators of antisemitism according to JDA's definition. It fails to demonstrate discrimination against Jews solely because they are Jewish or against Jewish institutions as such. Therefore, without additional context that shows hostility directed at Jews based on their identity alone, this statement is not considered antisemitic per the guidelines provided by the JDA.",1,0,1,0,0,0

This aligns with several key elements outlined by the IHRA:

1. **Conspiracy and Collective Blame**: It suggests that Jews, as a collective group, should hold each other accountable for political positions, which fits into the stereotype of Jewish people conspiring or being responsible for actions committed by individuals within their community.

2. **Mendacious Allegations**: The tweet attributes negative behavior (siding with Trump over Ilhan Omar, inciting Islamophobia) to Jews as a whole, rather than focusing on individual accountability. This is similar to the dehumanizing and stereotypical allegations highlighted in the IHRA definition.

3. **Double Standards**: There's an implicit double standard suggested here by singling out Jewish individuals for particular scrutiny or accountability, which reflects one of the examples given in the IHRA guidelines regarding antisemitism.

Overall, the tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Jews being collectively responsible and accountable for individual actions, resonating with several aspects of the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, we need to assess it against the criteria provided in the definition and guidelines. 

1. **Discrimination, Prejudice, Hostility or Violence**: The tweet encourages accountability within a specific community (Jews) rather than expressing discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions.

2. **Essentialization and Generalizations**: While the tweet suggests that Jews have a responsibility to hold their own accountable, it does not essentialize Jews by treating any particular character trait as inherent to all Jews. It encourages internal community action rather than making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews.

3. **Linking Jews to Evil or Conspiracy**: The tweet does not associate Jews with evil, conspiracies, hidden power, or control over other groups (such as governments, media, etc.). Instead, it addresses behavior related to political opinions within a specific context and community.

4. **Manifestations in Words, Images, Deeds**: There are no antisemitic words, images, or deeds present in the tweet. It does not use derogatory language, stereotypes, or imagery associated with classic antisemitism.

5. **Direct or Coded Speech**: The message is direct and calls for accountability within the Jewish community regarding specific political behavior (supporting a particular individual perceived as inciting Islamophobia). This is context-specific advice rather than coded speech about Jews in general.

6. **Denial of Holocaust**: There is no reference to denying or minimizing the Holocaust in this tweet.

7. **Israel and Palestine**: The tweet does not relate to Israel or Palestinian politics, hence it doesn't fall under either the examples that are ""on the face of it"" antisemitic or those that are not, according to sections B and C.

8. **Coded Criticism**: While calling for accountability within a religious group may be seen as sensitive, in this context, it does not align with JDA's examples of coded criticism of Jews (e.g., conspiracy theories about Jewish power).

The tweet also mentions “institutionalised antisemitism” within a party led by this individual, directly associating them with ongoing or systemic issues of prejudice against Jews.

According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, several relevant points apply here:

1. **Criticism of Israel and Implications**: If the criticism implies a double standard towards Israel—expecting behavior from it that is not expected from other nations—it aligns with the examples provided in the IHRA definition.

2. **Institutionalised Antisemitism**: Mentioning ""institutionalised antisemitism"" within a political party could be seen as holding Jews (or, by extension, Israel) collectively responsible for issues related to that party or its actions. This aligns with the IHRA's example of attributing responsibility to Jewish people collectively.

3. **Implication and Perception**: The way the tweet is phrased can perpetuate harmful stereotypes by implying a lack of concern for antisemitism within the person’s political sphere, thus potentially fueling negative perceptions about their stance on Jewish issues or Israel.

4. **Contextual Interpretation**: The overall context of the message matters significantly in determining its antisemitic nature. By questioning why ""he"" did not address institutionalized antisemitism and implying negligence or deliberate avoidance, it could be interpreted as indirectly endorsing such prejudice by failing to challenge it openly.

Overall, while this tweet does not explicitly express hatred towards Jews, it employs language that aligns with the IHRA's definition of antisemitic acts. It can imply a harmful narrative about institutional indifference or complicity in antisemitism, which is considered part of contemporary expressions of such prejudice.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews specifically because they are Jewish. The tweet in question criticizes a political leader for allegedly not addressing institutionalized antisemitism within his party and implies an omission of focus on Jewish concerns by suggesting that the words ""except the Jews"" were left out intentionally. 

1. **Direct Hostility or Prejudice**: The tweet does not express direct hostility or prejudice against Jews as individuals; rather, it critiques a political leader's actions (or lack thereof) regarding a specific issue—alleged institutional antisemitism.

2. **Context and Intent**: The critique is directed at the handling of issues within a political party, suggesting negligence or omission related to antisemitic behavior. It does not generalize negative traits about Jews nor does it portray them as evil or conspiratorial forces.

3. **Specific Allegation vs. Generalized Prejudice**: The tweet addresses a specific allegation concerning political leadership and policy response rather than making broad generalizations about Jewish people, which is what the JDA identifies as antisemitic behavior.

4. **Coded Speech**: While the language could be interpreted in various ways, there is no clear evidence that it uses coded speech to express antisemitism according to the guidelines of the JDA (e.g., using ""Jews"" as a code for broader negative stereotypes or linking them inherently with evil).

5. **Criticism vs. Antisemitism**: The tweet aligns more closely with guideline 13 of the JDA, which allows for evidence-based criticism of individuals or institutions, including political leaders and their handling of antisemitic incidents.

The tweet mentions an example of discrimination — ""No Jews, No Gays, need apply"" — which directly implies that Jews could be systematically excluded from employment opportunities based on their religion or perceived religious identity.

This aligns with the definition's examples of antisemitism that involve:

- Denying Jews opportunities available to others (antisemitic discrimination).
- Applying double standards by requiring behavior not expected of other groups.
  
The tweet specifically references a situation where it is suggested that Jews could be discriminated against in hiring practices. This reflects an instance of collective responsibility or stereotyping, as the statement implies that all individuals identified as Jewish would share certain undesired characteristics, leading to discrimination.

Furthermore, while the context here is opposition to proposed employment regulations and not necessarily endorsing these discriminatory practices, the tweet's inclusion of such a phrase could be seen as validating or normalizing an antisemitic perspective, even if indirectly. This makes it relevant under the IHRA framework that identifies expressions promoting exclusion based on stereotypical or prejudicial views toward Jews.

Therefore, given these considerations, this tweet can be classified as expressing antisemitism according to the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet expresses opposition to a proposed rule that could allow employers to discriminate based on religion, specifically mentioning the phrase ""No Jews, No Gays, need apply."" According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish. The tweet is not promoting such actions but rather criticizing a proposal that could lead to discriminatory practices.

The tweet does reference ""No Jews,"" which might appear problematic at first glance. However, in context, it highlights a specific concern about potential discrimination against Jews if the proposed rule were implemented. The mention of this phrase serves as an example of what is seen as unacceptable discrimination rather than endorsing or expressing prejudice or hostility towards Jewish people.

Furthermore, the tweet does not engage in generalizations, stereotypes, or negative character traits associated with Jews (as per JDA Guidelines 1 and 3). It does not use antisemitic language, imagery, or actions as defined by the guidelines. Instead, it takes a stance against what is perceived as discrimination and calls for the withdrawal of a proposal that could allow such discriminatory practices.

Trump saying we don't know our history or are traitors is both anti-Semitic AND echoes the gibberish from 1936 that is WHY we've voted Democratic since the 1960's.,Yes,"** The tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition due to several key elements:

1. **Collective Responsibility and Stereotyping**: By stating that ""80% of American Jews vote Democratic,"" the tweet uses statistics about Jewish voting behavior as a basis for attributing political identity and loyalty to the entire group. This aligns with the IHRA's point about accusations directed at Jews as a collective, suggesting they hold uniform views or actions, which can be seen as stereotypical.

2. **Historical Parallels**: The tweet references ""the gibberish from 1936"" and ties it to current political rhetoric. During the 1930s, particularly around 1936, antisemitic propaganda in Nazi Germany was prevalent, accusing Jews of being disloyal or traitors, which is echoed here by suggesting that Trump's statement about Jews not knowing their history or being traitors aligns with past antisemitic tropes.

3. **Implying Disloyalty**: The tweet mentions accusations of Jewish Americans being portrayed as traitors if they do not conform to a particular political ideology (""We're literally the second most reliable Democratic voters after black folks. Trump saying we don't know our history or are traitors""). This can be seen as echoing historical antisemitic charges that Jews cannot be loyal citizens, similar to accusations during World War II when Jewish people were often unjustly labeled disloyal.

4. **Context of Antisemitism**: The tweet draws a parallel between current political discourse and historical antisemitic rhetoric, suggesting that such discussions are part of a pattern that marginalizes or delegitimizes the Jewish community’s collective identity or political choices. This can contribute to an atmosphere where Jews are perceived as outsiders or conspirators in national politics.

Given these points, while the tweet is framed within a political critique, its elements resonate with aspects of antisemitism outlined by the IHRA definition—namely, the use of stereotypes, historical parallels to disloyalty accusations, and collective blaming. Therefore, it can be considered antisemitic under this framework.",No,"** 

The tweet in question discusses the political behavior of American Jews, particularly their voting patterns, and comments on former President Trump's remarks about Jewish Americans. To determine whether this tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze it against the provided definition and guidelines.

1. **Definition Check**: The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). The tweet does not express any direct discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence toward Jews based on their identity.

2. **Guideline 1 Analysis**: The statement that ""80% of American Jews vote Democratic"" is a factual claim about political behavior and does not essentialize or make sweeping negative generalizations about the Jewish population as a whole. It simply states an observed trend without attributing inherent character traits to Jews.

3. **Guideline 2 Analysis**: There is no indication in the tweet that Jews are linked to forces of evil, nor does it suggest any conspiracy theories such as hidden power or control over governments, media, etc.

4. **Guideline 3 Analysis**: The tweet does not contain antisemitic words, visual images, or deeds. It does not use derogatory language or imagery associated with antisemitism, nor does it advocate for harmful actions against Jews.

5. **Guideline 4 Analysis**: The tweet does not appear to be coded or indirect in a way that implies antisemitism. It directly addresses political behavior and historical voting patterns without veiled references to negative stereotypes or conspiracy theories.

6. **Contextual Consideration**: The tweet critiques Trump's statements, suggesting they echo harmful rhetoric from the past (e.g., 1936). This critique is framed as a defense against what the author perceives as misleading or dangerous comparisons, not as an endorsement of antisemitic ideas.

7. **Guideline 15 Analysis**: The tweet engages in political speech, which is protected under human rights instruments. It criticizes Trump's rhetoric without crossing into antisemitism, even if some might find the critique contentious.

This phrasing implies that Jews might be collectively responsible for actions or situations attributed to Fauci, fitting into the category where Jews are blamed for ""real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group."" Additionally, this could be seen as applying a stereotype or negative characterization of Jews by associating them with an unrelated issue about punctuation in journalism.

Furthermore, even though the tweet ostensibly makes a light-hearted commentary on the use of the Oxford comma, the underlying message has the potential to incite or reinforce harmful stereotypes and antisemitic perceptions. By equating ""Fauci"" with ""the Jews,"" it subtly suggests a conspiracy or unified Jewish influence behind Fauci's actions, which aligns with antisemitic rhetoric that charges Jews with conspiring to harm society.

In this context, the tweet could contribute to the public perception of Jewish people as being collectively responsible for specific issues or decisions, even when these are framed humorously. Such implications resonate with the IHRA definition's examples of antisemitism in how they can foster harmful stereotypes and collective blame against Jews.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. The tweet in question references ""Fauci or the Jews"" trending due to an Oxford comma issue and frames it humorously with a suggestion that using the Oxford comma illustrates why it is necessary.

To determine whether this constitutes antisemitism under the JDA guidelines:

1. **Context**: The mention of ""Fauci or the Jews"" likely refers to a real-world incident where a news article's lack of an Oxford comma led some readers to misinterpret a sentence as associating Dr. Fauci with Jewish individuals conspiratorially, due to the phrasing ""his sister and brother-in-law, Sidney and Eileen Blumenthal,"" which could be read as ""Sidney Blumenthal (Jew) and his (non-Jewish) wife Eileen"" without proper punctuation.

2. **Intent**: The tweet seems to point out an example of a misunderstanding caused by punctuation issues rather than expressing inherent prejudice or hostility towards Jews.

3. **Guidelines 4 and 5**: Guideline 4 discusses coded antisemitism, which involves indirect statements that suggest Jewish influence or conspiracy (e.g., ""the Rothschilds control the world""). However, this tweet does not make such a claim but instead highlights an editorial error leading to misinterpretation.

4. **Denial of Prejudice or Hostility**: The tweet does not express prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews. It comments on punctuation usage and indirectly addresses how language can lead to misunderstandings without expressing negative generalizations about Jews.

5. **Absence of Negative Stereotypes**: The tweet does not employ classical antisemitic stereotypes (guideline 2) such as linking Jews with evil or conspiracy. Instead, it discusses a non-antisemitic issue related to grammar and interpretation errors in journalism.

According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, making comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis is listed as an example of antisemitic behavior. While the tweet does not explicitly mention Israel, the use of Holocaust-related rhetoric in this manner can evoke sinister stereotypes and negative character traits associated with historical antisemitism. By implying a similar tactic is used today without context or clarification, it risks perpetuating harmful narratives that might be interpreted as blaming Jews collectively for past or present circumstances.

The tweet's framing around ""Holocaust Remembrance Day"" also adds a layer of insensitivity by potentially trivializing the memory and significance of the Holocaust to make a political point. This can contribute to an environment where antisemitic sentiments are normalized, particularly if such comparisons are perceived as unfounded or exaggerated. 

Therefore, considering these factors in line with the IHRA definition, the tweet could be seen as engaging in behavior that contributes to an antisemitic narrative, making it fall under the scope of what is considered antisemitic according to the provided criteria.",No,"To determine if the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition, we need to assess it against the provided guidelines.

1. **Definition of Antisemitism**: The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews because they are Jewish or Jewish institutions. The tweet does not directly exhibit discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence towards Jews simply for being Jewish. 

2. **Holocaust Remembrance Context**: The tweet references a historical tactic used to prevent European Jews from entering the United States during the 1930s in the context of Holocaust Remembrance Day. This can be viewed as an educational reminder about past injustices faced by Jews, rather than a statement that discriminates or is hostile towards them.

3. **Guideline Analysis**:
   - The tweet does not make sweeping negative generalizations or essentialize Jewish people (Guidelines A1).
   - It doesn’t link Jews to forces of evil or suggest a conspiracy (Guidelines A2).
   - There are no antisemitic words, images, or deeds described in the tweet (Guideline A3).
   - The statement does not appear coded with antisemitic intent; it appears to be making a historical reference rather than an implicit accusation against Jews or Jewish institutions today (Guideline A4).
   - It does not deny or minimize the Holocaust (Guideline A5).

Considering these points, the tweet seems focused on drawing parallels between past and potentially current exclusionary tactics affecting Jews, which is relevant in the context of Holocaust Remembrance Day. There is no indication that the statement is inherently antisemitic as per the JDA guidelines; rather, it may aim to highlight historical patterns of prejudice without promoting them.

Thus, based on the analysis according to the JDA definition and guidelines, the tweet does not qualify as antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Watch us.",Yes,"The tweet in question appears to use humor that involves Jewish identity and cultural practices, specifically referencing the preparation of a brisket with pickle brine. While it may be intended as humorous or sarcastic by the author, it can still fit into certain categories outlined by the IHRA definition of antisemitism.

1. **Stereotyping and Demonizing**: The tweet could be interpreted as invoking stereotypes about Jewish people being overly concerned with money or material gain (e.g., ""you can't just ferment *everything*""). This aligns with making dehumanizing or stereotypical allegations about Jews, which is considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition.

2. **Tone and Context**: The context in which humor targets a specific group often carries implicit bias or prejudice, even if not overtly hateful. If the audience perceives this as demeaning towards Jewish people by reducing cultural practices to stereotypes, it can contribute to an environment that fosters antisemitism.

3. **Potential Harm**: Even if no explicit harm is intended, perpetuating stereotypes through humor can contribute to a societal narrative where such stereotypes are normalized and unchallenged, which may lead to real-world discrimination or prejudice against Jews.

Therefore, according to the IHRA's definition of antisemitism, this tweet could be considered antisemitic due to its use of stereotypical language that dehumanizes Jewish people.",No,"**

The tweet in question uses humor and metaphor to make a statement about Jewish tradition (fermenting brisket, which is related to preparing pastrami) rather than directly expressing antisemitic sentiments as outlined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. Here's how it aligns with the guidelines provided:

1. **General Context:** The tweet doesn't essentialize Jews or make sweeping negative generalizations about them. Instead, it humorously references a cultural practice (fermenting brisket) and uses metaphorical language.

2. **Linkage to Evil or Conspiracies:** There is no suggestion in the tweet that Jews are linked to forces of evil or involved in conspiratorial control over any aspect of society. The metaphorical response by ""Jews"" simply highlights a cultural practice rather than asserting hidden power or malice.

3. **Manifestations in Words, Images, and Deeds:** The language used does not include classic antisemitic tropes such as depicting Jews with grotesque features, associating them with wealth negatively, or suggesting they are inherently problematic or threatening. It lacks any derogatory imagery or actions aimed at Jews as a group.

4. **Directness and Coding:** While the tweet uses metaphorical language (comparing cultural expression to fermentation), it is not coded in an antisemitic way. The context here does not imply hidden meanings that align with typical antisemitic narratives, such as conspiracy theories or stereotyping Jews as powerful or malevolent.

5. **Holocaust Denial:** There is no mention or denial of the Holocaust in the tweet, thus this guideline is irrelevant to the analysis.

Regarding the guidelines specific to Israel and Palestine:

- The tweet does not engage with politics around Israel or Zionism; therefore, it doesn't apply to these sections.

In conclusion, while humor can sometimes be misinterpreted, this tweet appears to employ a metaphorical play on words without any direct or indirect antisemitic intent as defined by the JDA. It lacks any elements of prejudice, hostility, or discrimination against Jews simply because they are Jewish.",1,0,1,0,0,0

**EXPLANTION:**

The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition due to its context and content, which align with several of the examples provided under this definition.

1. **Minimization of Jewish Suffering**: The statement ""Many Jews survived the Holocaust"" could be interpreted as minimizing or trivializing the atrocities committed against Jews during the Holocaust. This kind of minimization can contribute to a broader narrative that diminishes the severity and impact of antisemitic acts, such as those perpetrated by National Socialist Germany.

2. **Comparisons with Other Events**: The tweet compares the Holocaust to other tragic events (bushfires, Spanish Flu, tsunami) in a way that seems to downplay its unique horror. This can be seen as part of the denial or minimization of the genocide, which is explicitly mentioned as an example of antisemitism in the IHRA definition.

3. **Contextual Insensitivity**: By grouping the Holocaust with these other events without acknowledging its specific historical significance and impact on Jewish people worldwide, the tweet could perpetuate harmful stereotypes or contribute to a dismissive attitude toward Jewish suffering.

4. **Potential Harmful Stereotypes**: The reference to Pol Pot's regime is particularly sensitive, as it involves extreme violence against populations. Associating this with farming trivializes the genocide carried out by the Khmer Rouge and can be seen as reinforcing negative and harmful stereotypes about Jews if interpreted as downplaying Jewish suffering.

The tweet does not overtly express hatred towards Jews or employ classic antisemitic imagery. However, its content aligns with minimizing or denying aspects of the Holocaust, which is recognized in the IHRA definition as a form of contemporary antisemitism. Therefore, based on these factors, it can be considered antisemitic within this context.",No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly target Jews or Jewish institutions, nor does it employ antisemitic stereotypes or language as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). Instead, the tweet lists a series of comparisons between various historical events and current realities. Each point in the list is aimed at minimizing different tragic events rather than making statements about Jews as a group:

1. ""There were worse bushfires"" – This statement does not reference Jews or Jewish history.
2. ""Many Jews survived the Holocaust"" – While this mentions Jews, it is a factual statement that many people do survive the Holocaust without implying a minimization of its severity through an antisemitic lens.
3. ""Not everyone got the Spanish Flu"" – No mention of Jews; general historical fact about a global pandemic.
4. ""The rebuilt luxury hotels after the tsunami"" – Refers to post-disaster recovery, not related to Jewish people or institutions.
5. ""Hiroshima is very pretty these days"" – Pertains to Japan’s post-World War II reconstruction, unrelated to Jews.
6. ""Pol Pot did a lot for farming"" – References Cambodia's history under Pol Pot without mentioning Jews.

Although the tweet may be insensitive by implying that certain events should not be overly focused upon or remembered in particular ways, this insensitivity does not align with the antisemitic framework laid out by the JDA, which specifically involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. The content lacks any direct or coded antisemitism based on the guidelines provided by the JDA. Therefore, while the tweet may be criticized for its tone and implications about how to remember historical events, it does not meet the specific criteria of antisemitism according to the definition given in the JDA.",1,0,1,0,0,0

This could be interpreted as aligning with the IHRA definition of antisemitism in several ways:

1. **Negative Stereotypes:** The mention of Jews changing their names implies a historical or ongoing pressure to assimilate due to antisemitic attitudes, which reflects negatively on Jewish identity by suggesting it is something undesirable or incompatible with positive traits (such as beauty).

2. **Historical Context and Implications:** This notion can evoke the stereotype that Jews must conceal their identity to be accepted, hinting at underlying prejudice or discrimination. Such a statement might indirectly support the idea of Jews being ""other"" or inherently different in negative terms.

3. **Perception and Discrimination:** The tweet could contribute to a perception that Jewish people face unjust societal pressures, which aligns with antisemitic narratives about marginalization. This reinforces the harmful stereotype that Jewish identity is problematic, even if not explicitly stated.

4. **Overall Context:** While the tweet does not directly employ specific examples from the IHRA definition (such as accusations of world conspiracies or Holocaust denial), it still perpetuates a narrative where being Jewish is portrayed in a negative light, which can contribute to an antisemitic atmosphere.

Therefore, while indirect and perhaps subtle, this tweet aligns with the IHRA's broader understanding of antisemitism by propagating harmful stereotypes about Jewish identity.",No,"The tweet in question refers to historical events where being Jewish and beautiful were seen as dissonant, leading some Jews to change their names. This statement reflects a commentary on past societal pressures and does not inherently express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or against Jewish institutions as Jewish. 

According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves elements such as essentializing Jews, linking them to evil, making sweeping negative generalizations, or denying historical events like the Holocaust. The tweet does not engage in these actions.

The mention of name changes among Jews may relate to societal pressures and discrimination that individuals faced historically, which is a legitimate discussion about past injustices rather than an antisemitic statement. There are no indications of direct hostility, coded language about Jewish control or evil, or any other characteristic outlined in the JDA definition for antisemitism.

1. **Dehumanizing and Stereotyping**: The exchange implies a dismissal or undermining of Jewish knowledge and authority regarding their own religious texts. By suggesting ""no one knows what the original language means,"" it diminishes the capability and understanding that Jews have concerning their sacred texts, reinforcing a stereotype of them as less knowledgeable.

2. **Denying Authority**: The tweet challenges the authenticity and correctness of Jewish interpretation by portraying Christian voices as equally or more qualified to interpret Hebrew scripture despite not being part of the Jewish tradition. This can be seen as denying Jews' inherent authority over their own religious narratives.

3. **Cultural Insensitivity**: While not explicitly hateful, this exchange perpetuates a form of cultural insensitivity that suggests Jews are incorrect about their heritage and traditions. Such attitudes can contribute to broader patterns of marginalization and discrimination against Jewish people.

4. **Contextual Hostility**: The tone and structure of the conversation reflect an underlying hostility or dismissal towards Jewish claims of knowledge, which aligns with a historical pattern of antisemitic rhetoric that often challenges Jewish self-understanding and authority.

1. **Discrimination, Prejudice, Hostility or Violence**: The interaction in the tweet is a debate over interpretation of scripture rather than an expression of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. It involves a disagreement about biblical texts and their interpretations.

2. **Essentializing or Generalizations**: There are no sweeping negative generalizations made about Jewish people or essentializing of Jewish character traits in the tweet. The conversation revolves around differing opinions on scriptural interpretation without attributing inherent characteristics to Jews.

3. **Linkage to Evil or Conspiracy**: The tweet does not link Jews to forces of evil, nor does it suggest a conspiracy involving hidden power or control by Jews over various societal institutions.

4. **Manifestation in Words, Images, Deeds**: While the exchange might be contentious, it lacks hostile language or actions that specifically target Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish).

5. **Direct or Indirect Hostility**: The disagreement is presented in a context of discussing religious texts and does not involve coded speech about Jews or Israel being inherently evil or conspiratorial.

6. **Denial of the Holocaust**: There is no mention or implication related to the denial of the Holocaust within this tweet.

7. **Examples B and C Regarding Israel and Palestine**: The content of the tweet does not relate to Israel or Palestinian issues, nor does it make assertions about collective responsibility for Jewish people based on their religion or nationality.

The Nazi dictatorship had 12 years to institutionalize antisemitism into the fabric of life in Germany. The Palestinian leadership has had decades. https://t.co/nN92oHMFbZ,Yes,"The tweet contains several elements that align with the IHRA working definition of antisemitism:

1. **Historical Comparison**: It draws a direct comparison between the Nazi regime's institutionalization of antisemitism and the Palestinian leadership over decades. This can be seen as an application of double standards by equating the actions or intentions of two very different entities, which is mentioned in the IHRA definition.

2. **Implication of Intent**: By suggesting that the Palestinian leadership has had ""decades"" to institutionalize antisemitism, it implies a deliberate and malicious intent similar to that of Nazi Germany. This can be perceived as attributing sinister motives or conspiratorial behavior to Jews or Jewish-related entities (i.e., the state of Israel), which is identified in the IHRA definition.

3. **Stereotyping**: The statement uses stereotypes about antisemitic propaganda leading to catastrophic outcomes, implying a collective responsibility on the Palestinian leadership similar to that historically placed on Jews themselves during the Holocaust narrative.

4. **Context and Perception**: While some might argue this could be seen as criticism of political actions rather than an expression of hatred towards Jewish individuals or communities, in context, it plays into harmful stereotypes by aligning criticisms of Israel with historical antisemitic tropes about collective Jewish responsibility for negative outcomes.

Overall, the tweet employs a rhetorical strategy that aligns with several elements identified in the IHRA definition as manifestations of contemporary antisemitism.",No,"**

The tweet in question does not meet the criteria outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) for antisemitism. Here’s a breakdown of why it is classified as non-antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines:

1. **Comparison Context**: The tweet draws an analogy between the historical institutionalization of antisemitism by the Nazi regime and actions or rhetoric attributed to the Palestinian leadership over decades. This does not inherently target Jews as Jews but rather discusses political rhetoric and its potential implications.

2. **Absence of Direct Hostility Against Jews**: There is no explicit discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence directed against Jews in their identity as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). The tweet focuses on political discourse rather than attacking the Jewish community based on inherent characteristics or stereotypes.

3. **No Utilization of Stereotypes**: The tweet does not employ classical antisemitic symbols, images, or negative stereotypes. It refrains from portraying Jews in any derogatory manner and avoids essentializing traits to Jews as a group.

4. **No Collective Blame**: The statement does not hold Jewish individuals collectively responsible for the actions or policies of Israel, which would be considered antisemitic under guideline 7 of the JDA.

5. **Political Criticism**: According to guidelines 13-15 in section C, evidence-based criticism of political entities and their policies is not inherently antisemitic. The tweet critiques political narratives rather than making generalized negative claims about Jews or Jewish people.

6. **Sensitive Topic Contextualization**: While the tweet discusses a sensitive historical analogy (Nazis vs. Palestinian leadership), it does so without implying equivalence in actions but highlights sensitivity to propaganda, which is a legitimate discussion point not inherently antisemitic.

Therefore, based on the JDA definition and guidelines, this tweet does not qualify as antisemitic because it lacks elements of discrimination or hostility directed at Jews as Jews.",1,0,1,0,0,0

It refers to ""The Jews"" in a manner that invokes classic antisemitic tropes by suggesting an association between Jewish people and negative actions (thieves), which is consistent with ""mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such.""

Furthermore, the tweet's use of racial slurs alongside references to Jewish individuals compounds its problematic nature. By equating two distinct groups in a pejorative manner, it employs harmful stereotypes, thereby fitting into the IHRA examples that involve using classic antisemitic symbols and language to characterize Jews negatively.

The context provided by the tweet also suggests an intent to defame or harm the reputation of Jewish people, which is indicative of antisemitic behavior. The mention of ""code words"" implies a deliberate attempt to circumvent restrictions while still targeting Jewish individuals, aligning with behaviors that perpetuate antisemitic stereotypes and rhetoric.

In summary, by using language that invokes negative and false stereotypes about Jews and employing such descriptions in conjunction with racial slurs, the tweet meets the criteria for antisemitism as outlined by the IHRA definition.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze its content in relation to the provided definition and guidelines.

1. **Definition Analysis**: The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. 

2. **Guidelines Consideration**:
   - **Guideline 2**: This guideline highlights that classic antisemitism involves linking Jews with evil and attributing negative characteristics to them collectively. The tweet does not explicitly link Jews to any such concepts like a force of evil, conspiracy, or hidden powers.
   
   - **Guideline 3**: It mentions examples of antisemitic words and deeds, which include generalizations about Jews being wealthy, stingy, or unpatriotic. While the tweet mentions ""The Jews"" in conjunction with thieves, it does not provide further context that would indicate a stereotype specifically targeting Jewish wealth or character traits as inherent.

   - **Guideline 4**: This discusses coded language and context. The mention of “code words” suggests an awareness of potentially hidden meanings but doesn't itself confirm antisemitism without additional context linking Jews to negative generalizations or conspiracies.

3. **Content Analysis**:
   - The tweet references a pattern where ""all thieves"" are labeled with derogatory terms, mentioning both ""N*****s"" and ""The Jews."" However, it does not explicitly state any inherent characteristics of Jews as being associated with theft or other negative traits.
   
   - The mention of code words could imply an awareness of using language that might be interpreted negatively but lacks specific antisemitic content or context.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - There is no direct evidence in the tweet linking Jews to evil, conspiracy, or inherent negative characteristics as per the JDA guidelines.
   - Without additional context indicating hostility or prejudice specifically against Jewish people or institutions, the tweet does not meet the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

This reluctance aligns with several aspects of the IHRA's examples:

1. **Denying or Downplaying the Holocaust:** The reference to not speaking about ""what was fate of Jews"" during a holy day could imply an intention to deny or obscure historical facts related to the Holocaust, especially if it is perceived as avoiding the acknowledgment of Jewish suffering and genocide.

2. **Cultural or Religious Evasion:** By linking this reluctance to speak with a holy day, there may be an underlying cultural or religious justification that indirectly supports denial or minimization of the Holocaust, which fits within the IHRA's examples of antisemitic actions such as denying the fact, scope, mechanisms, or intentionality of the genocide.

3. **Use of Stereotypes and Avoidance:** The statement could also be perceived as employing a stereotype where Jews are seen as conspiring to hide their historical suffering for personal or collective gain, which aligns with antisemitic rhetoric that involves sinister stereotypes about Jewish people.

Given these points, the tweet can reasonably be considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition because it implies an unwillingness to acknowledge or discuss significant and well-documented events in Jewish history, potentially contributing to harmful narratives.",No,"The tweet from @RahulEaswar states, ""It's holy day I should not says what was fate of Jews."" This message, as it stands, does not explicitly exhibit discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews. It appears to express a personal choice to refrain from discussing the fate of Jews on a holy day, rather than conveying an antisemitic sentiment.

1. **Lack of Explicit Antisemitism**: The tweet doesn't contain any direct or indirect statements that fit within the JDA's definition of antisemitism, such as making negative generalizations about Jews or linking them to evil forces. There are no words, images, or deeds in the tweet that could be considered antisemitic according to the guidelines provided.

2. **Context and Intention**: Without additional context or explanation for why the author chose not to discuss ""what was fate of Jews,"" it's difficult to determine any underlying prejudice or hostility towards Jews. The statement is more reflective of personal discretion during a holy day rather than an expression rooted in antisemitic beliefs.

3. **Absence of Holocaust Denial**: The tweet does not deny, minimize, or distort the history of the Holocaust, which would be explicitly classified as antisemitic under guideline 5.

4. **Potential for Misinterpretation**: While the ambiguity might lead to misinterpretations depending on context (e.g., discussing sensitive historical events like the Holocaust), the content itself lacks any explicit antisemitic messaging or intent.

While the specific content of the linked material isn't available in this analysis, certain elements can be inferred based on common patterns seen in similar contexts.

1. **Stereotyping and Dehumanization**: The IHRA definition highlights that antisemitism often includes ""dehumanizing"" and ""stereotypical allegations about Jews."" If the tweet or link portrays Jews negatively by likening them to something generally considered unfavorable, it would align with this aspect of the definition.

2. **General Pattern Recognition**: Historically, some comparisons liken non-Jews unfavorably to Jews in ways that perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: Although criticism of Israel itself isn't necessarily antisemitic, using such criticism to imply a broad and negative stereotype about Jews in general could contribute to antisemitism. If the link or tweet broadly maligns Jews by association or implies negative stereotypes about Jewish people as a collective, it fits within IHRA's illustrative examples.

According to the IHRA definition, such an act can be considered antisemitic if it involves a conflation of criticism directed toward Israel with criticism or hostility towards Jewish people, treating them as a monolithic group responsible for actions attributed to the Israeli state.

The tweet suggests that Trump is ""casually switching"" between terms, which could imply a lack of distinction between criticizing a government (Israel) and making generalizations about an ethnic or religious group (Jews). This aligns with the IHRA definition's concern over holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the State of Israel. By doing so, it risks perpetuating the notion that Jews are synonymous with Israeli policies, which can contribute to stereotypes and negative perceptions.

Furthermore, the use of terms like ""witch hunters"" and labeling opponents as ""indistinguishable from the racist liar in the Whitehouse"" adds a charged rhetoric that could be interpreted as dehumanizing or demonizing those who criticize Trump. While this language itself isn't directly antisemitic under IHRA's definition, it contributes to an overall atmosphere where such conflation of Jews and Israel is tolerated.

However, several factors must be evaluated:

1. **Context and Intent**: The tweet criticizes Trump's behavior without directly engaging in or promoting any of the behaviors outlined as antisemitic by JDA itself. It accuses him of doing something that could potentially be interpreted as antisemitic (switching between ""Israel"" and ""Jews"") but does not engage in it.

3. **No Direct Antisemitic Content**: The tweet does not contain direct antisemitic language, images, or actions against Jews as described in guidelines A.3 and A.4. It neither uses derogatory stereotypes nor suggests Jews possess inherent negative traits.

In conclusion, while the tweet addresses a potential instance of antisemitism by criticizing Trump's alleged conflation of ""Israel"" with ""Jews,"" it does not itself engage in any behavior classified as antisemitic under JDA guidelines.

1. **Collective Pressure on Identity**: The tweet suggests that throughout history, there has been consistent external pressure on Jewish people to abandon their traditional beliefs or identities in favor of conforming to dominant societal expectations—first to become Christians/Muslims, and now to be anti-Zionists. This echoes the antisemitic trope of Jews needing to change or hide their identity.

2. **Moral Judgment**: The statement includes a moral judgment about Jewish beliefs, implying that it is problematic for Jews to maintain Zionism. It hints at an expectation for Jews to adopt viewpoints contrary to their own religious and cultural practices, which can be seen as imposing external views on what constitutes acceptable Jewish belief or practice.

3. **Historical Context of Scapegoating**: By referencing historical pressures faced by Jews to convert or change their beliefs, the tweet indirectly invokes a narrative of ongoing persecution and scapegoating—a common antisemitic theme where Jews are portrayed as perpetually out of favor unless they conform to external expectations.

4. **Collective Blame**: The use of ""a Jew is not maligned for holding beliefs held by most Jews"" suggests that Jews, en masse, are criticized or pressured because of their collective identity and the common beliefs associated with it, which aligns with antisemitic practices of attributing blame to all Jews based on actions or characteristics of a few.

In summary, the tweet reflects elements of coercive pressure on Jewish identity, collective judgment, and historical scapegoating consistent with the IHRA’s examples of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question discusses historical pressures on Jews to convert or adopt certain beliefs, and it highlights a perceived contemporary pressure for Jews to become anti-Zionists. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. 

1. **General Context**: The tweet does not express inherent negative generalizations about Jews as a whole; rather, it reflects on historical and contemporary pressures experienced by Jews. It does not attribute any characteristics of evil to Jews.

2. **Linkage to Evil (Guideline 2)**: There is no assertion that links Jews with forces of evil or suggests they possess hidden powers manipulating events for their own agenda. The tweet simply observes a pattern without attributing malice or conspiratorial intent.

3. **Manifestations**: The tweet neither contains antisemitic words, images, nor deeds as outlined in guideline 3. It does not assault Jewish individuals, institutions, or use derogatory imagery.

4. **Direct/Indirect Speech (Guideline 4)**: While the message acknowledges a trend of maligned beliefs among Jews, it does not employ coded language that implicitly targets Jews negatively. The focus is on external pressures rather than internal traits or actions attributed to Jews themselves.

5. **Denial of the Holocaust (Guideline 5)**: The tweet makes no mention of the Holocaust and thus cannot be assessed under this guideline.

6. **Israel/Palestine Context**: Although it touches upon Zionism, the tweet does not explicitly apply negative stereotypes associated with antisemitism to Israel or its people. It speaks more broadly about societal pressures rather than attributing actions to Jewish individuals based on their identity.

7. **Collective Responsibility (Guideline 7)**: The tweet does not hold all Jews collectively responsible for Zionism or Israeli policies but instead suggests a social trend that affects them.

In conclusion, the content of the tweet can be interpreted as an observation about societal dynamics rather than an expression of antisemitic sentiment per the guidelines provided by the JDA. Therefore, it is not considered antisemitic under these criteria.",1,0,1,0,0,0
1247468823705518086,mariusz_jaskot,2020-04-07 10:18:39+00:00,0,Jews,"1 Cor 1:22-24\n\nThe Jews demand miracles and the Greeks look for wisdom, but we are preaching a crucified Christ; to the Jews an obstacle that they cannot get over, to the pagans madness, 1/2",Yes,"The tweet references 1 Corinthians 1:22-24 from the Bible, which describes a distinction between how ""Jews"" and ""Greeks"" (or pagans) perceive the message of Christianity. According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, one of the manifestations includes making dehumanizing or demonizing allegations about Jews as a collective group.

In this context, the tweet suggests that Jews are characterized by their demand for miracles and inability to understand the preaching of Christ, portraying them in a negative light as having an insurmountable obstacle. This could be interpreted as employing a stereotype that attributes certain negative characteristics solely to Jewish people, thus fitting into the pattern of dehumanizing or demonizing them.

Furthermore, while theological discourse can involve discussions about religious texts and their interpretations, when such discussions reinforce stereotypes or negative perceptions without context or critical analysis, they may contribute to antisemitic narratives. The tweet does not provide any additional commentary or perspective that might clarify its intent beyond the Biblical passage, which could otherwise mitigate its potential interpretation as antisemitic.

Therefore, based on the IHRA definition and examples of what constitutes antisemitism, this tweet can be seen as aligning with the characteristics of making stereotypical allegations about Jews.",No,"** To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze it against the definition and guidelines provided in the declaration.

1. **Definition Check:**
   - The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence specifically against Jews because they are Jewish or against Jewish institutions as Jewish.
   - The tweet references a biblical passage from 1 Corinthians 1:22-24, discussing differences in how Jews and Greeks (pagans) respond to the message of Christ. This is part of a theological reflection rather than an expression of prejudice, discrimination, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews.

2. **Guideline Analysis:**
   - Guideline 1 discusses essentializing or making negative generalizations about populations, which can be related to racism and antisemitism.
   - The tweet does mention ""Jews demand miracles,"" but it is within a religious text's context discussing historical perspectives on how different groups received the message of Christianity. It doesn't generalize modern Jews or ascribe inherently negative traits to them.

3. **Contextual Understanding:**
   - In biblical and theological discussions, references like these often appear in contexts exploring doctrinal history rather than making contemporary claims about Jewish people.
   - The tweet does not invoke classic antisemitic themes such as linking Jews with evil, conspiracy theories, or portraying Jews as controlling hidden forces (as outlined in Guideline 2).

4. **Nature of the Content:**
   - There is no hostility, discrimination, or violence depicted in the tweet. It's a quote from scripture meant to illustrate differing receptions to Christian teachings.
   - The reference does not equate modern Jewish identity with an ""obstacle"" in a way that suggests Jews as a group are inherently opposed to faith or reason; rather, it reflects Paul’s historical observations.

5. **Absence of Coded Speech:**
   - The tweet does not appear to use coded language to suggest antisemitic ideas under the guise of discussing Israel or Zionism (Guidelines 6-10).

In summary, while some interpretations might find theological discussions sensitive, this specific tweet doesn't meet the JDA's criteria for antisemitism. It lacks elements of modern prejudice, hostility, or discrimination against Jews as a group. Therefore, according to the JDA definition and guidelines, it is not antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0
1247515744654458881,nhmeems,2020-04-07 13:25:05+00:00,0,Jews,“Fauci or the Jews” is trending because the Washington Post doesn’t use the Oxford comma &amp; gosh Fred there’s a good illustration of why you should use the Oxford comma,Yes,"The tweet references ""Fauci or the Jews"" in the context of a discussion about the Oxford comma, which is an example of using the juxtaposition of Dr. Anthony Fauci's name with ""the Jews."" This pairing can imply an equivalence between a specific Jewish person (Dr. Fauci) and Jewish people as a group. Such comparisons often suggest that individuals are being targeted not for their personal actions but because they are perceived to be part of a collective, which is a common antisemitic trope.

The IHRA definition points out that antisemitism can involve accusing Jews collectively of what might have been done by an individual Jewish person or implying a connection between Jews as a group and certain negative traits or behaviors. This tweet could fall under the category of stereotypical allegations about Jews, suggesting they are involved in conspiracies or other harmful activities simply because one prominent Jewish figure (Dr. Fauci) is mentioned alongside them.

Furthermore, by trending ""Fauci or the Jews,"" it perpetuates a narrative that conflates an individual's professional actions with those of a religious or ethnic group, which aligns with the IHRA’s examples of antisemitic acts. Even though this might be framed humorously or satirically in some contexts, the underlying implication remains problematic as per the IHRA definition.

Therefore, considering these factors and how they align with the IHRA's criteria for identifying manifestations of antisemitism, the tweet can be considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question uses the phrase ""Fauci or the Jews"" to illustrate a point about the importance of using the Oxford comma in writing, suggesting that without it, there's an implication of a choice between Anthony Fauci and Jewish people. This usage does not inherently display discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or against Jewish institutions because they are Jewish.

1. **Contextual Intent**: The tweet appears to be using the phrase as a hypothetical example for grammatical instruction rather than expressing any genuine belief in a conspiracy involving Jews. It references an editorial choice by a newspaper (the omission of the Oxford comma) leading to a misinterpretation that could humorously suggest a choice between Fauci and Jews.

2. **Lack of Hostility or Prejudice**: The tweet does not express hostility, prejudice, or any negative generalizations about Jewish people as a group. It discusses an editorial oversight rather than promoting any form of antisemitic sentiment.

3. **Absence of Classic Antisemitic Themes**: There is no indication that the tweet links Jews to evil forces, conspiracies, or other classic antisemitic themes as outlined in guideline 2 of the JDA. The discussion centers on punctuation and its potential for misinterpretation, not on attributing any inherent negative characteristics to Jewish people.

4. **No Direct or Indirect Antisemitism**: The tweet does not directly accuse Jews of anything nor does it employ coded language that would suggest antisemitic views as outlined in guideline 4. It neither denies the Holocaust (guideline 5) nor applies classical antisemitic stereotypes to Israel (guidelines 6-10).

In conclusion, while the phrase ""Fauci or the Jews"" might be sensitive and could potentially evoke concerns due to its historical misuse in conspiracy theories, the specific context of this tweet does not align with any of the antisemitic indicators outlined by the JDA. It is framed as a grammatical discussion rather than an expression of prejudice or hostility towards Jewish people.",1,0,1,0,0,0

This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism by employing negative character traits associated with Jews. By suggesting that Jews do not understand their own religious texts, it promotes a stereotype of ignorance or incompetence among Jewish people regarding fundamental aspects of their culture and religion.

Such a statement can contribute to the broader pattern of depicting Jews as lacking insight or wisdom about their traditions and beliefs, which is a form of antisemitic rhetoric. While the tweet does not explicitly fall under any specific category listed in the IHRA examples (such as Holocaust denial or conspiracy myths), it still fits within the general framework by perpetuating negative stereotypes about Jewish knowledge and intellectual capability.

The context here is crucial. If the intent behind the statement is to marginalize or discredit Jewish scholarship, faith, or interpretation of their own religious texts, then it can be considered antisemitic as per the IHRA's working definition. This understanding requires considering whether such statements contribute to a broader pattern of discrimination or prejudice against Jews.",No,"The tweet in question states that ""The Jews have very uninformed views about the meaning of Hebrew words in Jewish scripture."" To determine whether this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, we must examine the content through the framework provided.

1. **Discrimination or Hostility**: The tweet seems to make a generalization about Jews' understanding of their own religious texts. However, it doesn't imply discrimination, hostility, or violence against Jews as individuals or institutions.

2. **Essentializing or Negative Generalizations (Guideline 1)**: While the statement does generalize about Jewish understanding of Hebrew scripture, it is focused on a specific aspect (knowledge of scriptural interpretation) rather than essentializing Jews or attributing inherent negative traits to them.

3. **Linkage to Evil (Guideline 2)**: The tweet doesn't link Jews to evil, nor does it suggest they possess any hidden power or engage in conspiracies against others.

4. **Manifestations of Antisemitism (Guideline 3)**: There is no indication that the statement manifests through words, images, or actions that are typically antisemitic, such as depicting Jews with negative stereotypes or engaging in physical acts against Jewish individuals or institutions.

5. **Direct/Indirect/Coded Speech (Guideline 4)**: The tweet does not use coded language to convey an antisemitic message. It directly addresses a perceived lack of knowledge without implying any malicious intent or broader conspiracy.

6. **Denial of the Holocaust (Guideline 5)**: This aspect is not relevant, as the tweet makes no reference to the Holocaust or historical events related to it.

7. **Israel and Palestine Contexts (Guidelines B and C)**: The tweet does not mention Israel or Zionism directly, nor does it attribute collective responsibility to Jews for any political actions. Thus, these guidelines do not apply here.

In summary, while the tweet could be considered disrespectful or ignorant of Jewish scholarship and religious understanding, it lacks elements that would classify it as antisemitic under the JDA's definition and guidelines. It doesn't involve hostility, discrimination, or a linkage to evil, nor does it fall into any other category listed in the guidelines.",1,0,1,0,0,0
1246822693225279489,Changeling_1,2020-04-05 15:31:09+00:00,0,Jews,"@RuthSmeeth @Keir_Starmer Are you saying that all Jews belong to one collective society with a common mindset because, if you do, I have some working definitions from the IHRA you probably need to read.....",Yes,"The tweet in question can be interpreted as antisemitic according to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, particularly when considering the context and implications. The statement suggests that all Jews belong to a single collective society with a common mindset, which aligns with certain manifestations of antisemitism outlined by the IHRA.

1. **Perception of Jews as a Monolithic Group**: The tweet implies that Jews share an identical set of beliefs or behaviors simply due to their Jewish identity. This perception can be considered dehumanizing and stereotypical because it reduces individual diversity within the Jewish community to a singular, collective characteristic. According to the IHRA definition, such generalizations contribute to harmful stereotypes.

2. **Implication of Conspiring**: By suggesting that Jews share a ""common mindset,"" the tweet hints at an underlying conspiracy or unified agenda among Jews, which mirrors antisemitic tropes about Jewish people having undue influence or conspiring together for specific purposes. This aspect aligns with IHRA's mention of attributing to Jews conspiracies aimed at harming humanity.

3. **Context and Impact**: While the tweet might be intended as a call for reading specific definitions (such as those from the IHRA), its framing can still perpetuate harmful stereotypes if perceived by readers as reinforcing these negative perceptions. The implication that understanding or agreement with such antisemitic viewpoints requires further education could unintentionally normalize or trivialize them, rather than challenging and rejecting antisemitism.

In summary, although the tweet might be attempting to reference IHRA definitions to counteract an accusation of antisemitism, its phrasing inadvertently reinforces harmful stereotypes about Jewish people as a collective. Therefore, it fits within certain elements outlined in the IHRA working definition of antisemitism.",No,"** The tweet in question asks whether the individuals are suggesting that all Jews belong to a single collective society with a common mindset, and it references working definitions from the IHRA (International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance) for further reading. This is not inherently antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). 

Here's why:

1. **Context of Inquiry:** The tweet appears to be asking a question rather than making a statement or accusation. It seeks clarification about whether certain views are being expressed, which does not in itself constitute antisemitic expression.

2. **Reference to IHRA Definitions:** Mentioning the IHRA definitions suggests an intent to engage with established guidelines on identifying antisemitism, indicating a focus on understanding and defining rather than promoting hate or prejudice.

3. **Absence of Stereotyping or Hostility:** The tweet does not itself stereotype Jews as possessing inherent negative traits, nor does it suggest that they are linked to evil forces or possess undue power. It simply raises a question about collective identity, which can be part of legitimate discussion on how groups are perceived and discussed.

4. **Lack of Direct or Indirect Hostility:** There is no direct hostility, violence, discrimination, or prejudice expressed in the tweet itself. The tone is questioning rather than accusatory or derogatory.

5. **Engagement with Political Discourse:** Engaging with political discourse about collective identity and referencing international guidelines like those from IHRA can be part of a legitimate debate on how to discuss national or ethnic groups without crossing into antisemitism, as long as it does not imply negative stereotypes or hostilities against Jews.

Overall, the tweet is a request for clarification and refers to an established framework (IHRA) to understand definitions related to antisemitism. It does not meet the criteria of expressing antisemitic views under the JDA definition.",1,0,1,0,0,0

This aligns with certain examples of contemporary antisemitism outlined by the IHRA, such as holding Jewish individuals collectively responsible for perceived neglect by political figures.

The tweet suggests a pattern in which Jewish victims are being ignored or marginalized by the administration, implying that this lack of attention is due to Jews not being considered ""his constituents."" This could be seen as attributing conspiratorial motives to the administration's actions (or lack thereof) specifically towards Jews, similar to the IHRA's description of antisemitism involving the perception of Jews having undue influence or control, which results in negative treatment.

While it may seem like criticism of political leadership, the specific focus on Jewish victims being ignored could foster a perception that aligns with negative stereotypical allegations about Jews as a group, potentially seen as conspiring to harm humanity by drawing attention away from their issues. Thus, the tweet falls within the scope of what might be considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition due to its implications and focus on collective responsibility or neglect towards Jewish individuals based on their identity.",No,"** 

The tweet in question lists several instances where it claims former President Trump did not publicly respond to various events, including attacks on Jews in New York. To determine if this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to assess whether it discriminates, preaches prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions.

1. **Context and Content:** The tweet highlights a perceived lack of response by Trump to various crises affecting different groups, including U.S. soldiers in Kenya, citizens in Puerto Rico, and people attacked in New York. It suggests that Trump does not care about these groups because they are not his constituents.

2. **Lack of Negative Stereotypes or Hostility:** The tweet does not use any negative stereotypes specifically against Jews or Jewish institutions (as outlined in guidelines 2 and 3). There is no mention of Jews being wealthy, stingy, unpatriotic, or linked to evil forces.

3. **No Direct or Indirect Attack on Jews as a Group:** The content does not hold Jews collectively responsible for any action or suggest that they are inherently problematic (guideline 7). It does not require Jews to publicly condemn Israel or Zionism, nor does it question their right to exist and flourish in the State of Israel.

4. **Criticism Not of Jewish People but of Political Action:** The criticism is directed at Trump's perceived lack of response rather than at Jewish people or institutions. This aligns more with guideline 13 under section C, where evidence-based criticism of political figures or states is not considered antisemitic.

5. **No Holocaust Denial or Minimization:** There is no mention of the Holocaust, denial of its occurrence, or minimization of its impact (guideline 5).

In conclusion, while the tweet criticizes Trump for his perceived inaction on issues affecting Jews among other groups, it does not target Jewish people or institutions with prejudice, hostility, or violence. Therefore, according to the JDA definition, this tweet is not antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0
1253517080638492673,HikindDov,2020-04-24 02:52:15+00:00,0,Jews,.@jvplive activist Reuben Telushkin actually made this made absurd statement about the home of half the world's Jews: “Israel is antisemitic.”\nhttps://t.co/TkLjw7rAK0 https://t.co/WdEJ53e4jY,Yes,"According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, it is crucial to distinguish between legitimate criticism of Israel and statements that may be perceived as expressing antisemitism. Criticism of Israel, similar to that leveled against any other country, cannot be regarded as antisemitic. However, there are examples provided in the definition where certain types of accusations or generalizations about Jews or Israel can cross into antisemitism.

In this case, Reuben Telushkin's statement that ""Israel is antisemitic"" can potentially be interpreted within the context of several points outlined by the IHRA. Notably:

1. **Applying Double Standards**: If the statement implies that Israel is held to a standard not applied to other democratic nations, it could be considered an application of double standards.

2. **Using Classic Antisemitic Symbols or Images**: Associating the entire state with antisemitism can be seen as applying age-old stereotypes and negative character traits historically used against Jews.

3. **Collective Responsibility**: This statement may also echo the notion of holding Jews collectively responsible for actions taken by Israel, treating all Jewish people as one monolithic entity.

These elements suggest that Telushkin's statement could indeed fall under the IHRA definition of antisemitism because it potentially involves making broad and negative generalizations about a collective (in this case, linking Jewish identity with an entire state) in a manner consistent with traditional antisemitic stereotypes. While the context and intent behind the statement would further clarify its meaning, based on the information given, it aligns with several criteria described in the IHRA's examples of antisemitism.",No,"** The tweet in question states that Reuben Telushkin made an ""absurd statement"" about Israel being antisemitic. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), for a statement or action to be considered antisemitic, it must involve discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish.

1. **Context and Content**: The tweet reports that Telushkin claimed ""Israel is antisemitic."" This claim alone does not inherently target Jews because they are Jewish; rather, it critiques the state of Israel. Criticism of a country's policies or actions is distinct from criticism based on racial or ethnic characteristics of its citizens.

2. **Guideline 13**: The JDA specifically acknowledges that evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state—its institutions, founding principles, policies, and practices—is not inherently antisemitic (guideline 13). This includes critiques regarding how Israel influences events in the world. The statement ""Israel is antisemitic"" would fall under this category if it refers to actions or policies perceived as discriminatory against Jews.

3. **Differentiation**: It's important to differentiate between criticizing a state and making generalizations about an ethnic or religious group. The JDA outlines that criticism of Israeli government practices, when not attributing these practices to Jewish people globally, does not meet the criteria for antisemitism.

4. **Absurdity and Context**: The tweet describes Telushkin’s statement as ""absurd,"" but it doesn't provide context or specific content of his argument. Without further details on how he arrived at this conclusion (e.g., citing particular actions by Israeli authorities), we cannot assume the critique is rooted in antisemitic stereotypes or generalizations about Jews.

5. **Broader Implications**: While some might view the statement ""Israel is antisemitic"" as contentious, especially if perceived as exaggerating or misrepresenting Israel's policies, this does not automatically equate to antisemitism under JDA guidelines unless it involves attributing actions of a state to an entire ethnic or religious group.

In summary, based on the information provided and according to the JDA definition, labeling Israel as ""antisemitic"" in itself is not considered antisemitic. It would require additional context suggesting that Jews globally are being targeted for their Jewish identity to meet the criteria set out by the guidelines.",1,0,1,0,0,0

1. **Stereotyping and Generalization**: The tweet employs a stereotype that suggests Jewish people are not regarded as legitimate constituents by President Trump, implying they have less significance or importance than others. This aligns with the IHRA's mention of sinister stereotypes where Jews might be perceived differently in terms of their societal status.

2. **Implication of Conspiracy and Influence**: By stating ""It’s not that he’s not our President, it’s that we’re not his constituents,"" the tweet insinuates a form of conspiratorial thinking about Jewish people being excluded from receiving attention or aid based on political influence. This aligns with the IHRA examples where Jews are depicted as having undue influence in ways that lead to negative outcomes for others.

3. **Denigration**: The overall tone and implication that President Trump discriminates against Jewish people by not responding to their issues, while attending to others', can be seen as an expression of dehumanization or denigration. This plays into antisemitic themes where Jews are perceived as being treated unfairly in comparison to other groups.

While the tweet does not explicitly use classic antisemitic symbols or accusations (such as blood libel or Holocaust denial), it fits within broader patterns of modern antisemitism by implying differential treatment and conspiratorial exclusion of Jewish people. This interpretation considers the context provided by the IHRA definition, which emphasizes perception and manifestation in various forms, including speech.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is defined as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews because they are Jewish. The tweet you provided critiques President Trump's response to different events, suggesting that he prioritizes some groups over others and does not care about certain constituents. While it mentions an attack on ""Jews"" in New York alongside other incidents, the primary focus of the tweet is a critique of perceived political neglect or bias by a public official.

1. **Contextual Critique**: The tweet addresses a pattern in Trump's responses—or lack thereof—to various events, including attacks on Jews. It does not attribute any inherent negative traits to Jewish people or depict them as part of an evil conspiracy. Instead, it frames the issue within broader criticisms of political conduct.
   
2. **Absence of Essentializing or Generalization**: The tweet does not essentialize Jewish individuals by attributing specific character traits to them as a group. It mentions Jews in relation to an event without making sweeping generalizations about Jewish people.

3. **No Linkage with Evil**: There is no indication that the tweet links Jews to evil, conspiracy theories, or hidden agendas. The mention of Jews appears solely within the context of reporting on events and Trump's responses.

4. **Coded Language**: The language does not employ coded antisemitic phrases or imagery that would align with historical stereotypes or accusations against Jews as outlined in the JDA guidelines.

5. **Focus on Political Critique**: The critique is focused on political behavior, specifically a perceived lack of response from Trump to various incidents. It doesn't single out Jewish people for criticism but rather includes them among other affected groups.

Therefore, while the tweet may be critical or controversial, it does not meet the JDA's criteria for antisemitism based on its content and context. The focus is on political critique rather than expressing prejudice against Jews as a group.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Asking for my Jewish sister.,Yes,"The tweet in question appears to be potentially antisemitic according to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, particularly because it can involve elements that fit certain aspects of the definition. 

1. **Connotation and Context**: The phrase ""what exactly do the Jews need 'redemption' from?"" may carry implicit stereotypes or insinuations about Jewish people needing salvation or liberation from a negative condition or influence. This kind of question could be interpreted as suggesting that Jews are in some way responsible for negative circumstances or actions, which can echo harmful stereotypes.

2. **Historical and Cultural Sensitivities**: The term ""redemption"" carries significant historical weight due to its association with antisemitic tropes like the ""blood libel"" or ideas about Jewish conspiracies needing to be corrected or eliminated by non-Jewish forces. Such language can reinforce a perception of Jews as a collective being in need of correction, which is an aspect highlighted in the IHRA examples.

3. **Potential for Misinterpretation**: Without further context that clarifies the intent behind the question, it could easily be perceived as reinforcing negative stereotypes or suggesting conspiratorial elements about Jewish people, fitting into some of the illustrative manifestations provided by the IHRA definition.

4. **Intended vs. Perceived Meaning**: Even if the sender does not intend for the tweet to be antisemitic, its wording can contribute to harmful narratives and perpetuate stereotypes that align with those described in the IHRA examples as antisemitic.

In conclusion, while context is crucial and a fuller understanding of intent might alter this assessment, based on the wording alone, the tweet risks being perceived as antisemitic under the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet ""@EinatWilf What exactly do the Jews need 'redemption' from? Asking for my Jewish sister."" does not explicitly contain elements that would classify it as antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition. Here’s a breakdown of why this conclusion is reached:

1. **Antisemitic Characteristics**: The JDA outlines characteristics such as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews, particularly when associating them with evil or conspiracies. This tweet does not demonstrate any explicit antisemitic language, imagery, or deeds.

2. **Context and Intent**: The question seems to inquire about the concept of ""redemption"" from a Jewish perspective rather than making a derogatory statement or expressing hostility. It lacks context that would suggest an underlying prejudicial intent against Jews as a group.

3. **Double Entendre/Indirect Implications**: While some might interpret the term ""redemption"" in various ways, without additional context indicating negative stereotypes (e.g., linking it to harmful myths about Jewish control or evil), this alone does not meet the JDA criteria for antisemitism.

4. **Coded Language and Stereotypes**: The tweet does not use coded language that ties back to classical antisemitic themes, such as conspiracy theories or demonization of Jews. It lacks the negative stereotypes or symbols outlined in guidelines 2 and 3 of the JDA.

5. **Political Context**: If this tweet is part of a broader discussion about Israel and Palestine, it does not automatically become antisemitic unless it engages with examples that are defined as such in sections B and C of the JDA. The question appears to seek clarification rather than assert any prejudice or hostility.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the tweet alone, there is no clear evidence within the JDA framework suggesting that this message contains antisemitic content. It lacks explicit or implicit elements necessary for such a classification without additional context indicating otherwise.",1,0,1,0,0,0

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism can include drawing comparisons of contemporary actions or policies to those of the Nazis or suggesting similarities between current events and historical acts against Jews.

By linking Holocaust Remembrance Day with exclusionary tactics aimed at Jews, the tweet could be interpreted as implying that there is a parallel between the systematic oppression faced by Jews during the Holocaust and present-day situations. This comparison can minimize the unique historical significance and gravity of the Holocaust, which aligns with IHRA’s example of antisemitic acts that involve equating contemporary Israeli policies or actions to those of the Nazis.

Furthermore, the tweet might imply a negative stereotyping or delegitimization of efforts to remember the Holocaust, possibly suggesting that such remembrance is unwarranted or exaggerated. By doing so, it could also be interpreted as denying or trivializing the specific historical context and significance of the Holocaust, which are noted in the IHRA definition as antisemitic acts.

Therefore, based on these points and considering the overall context provided by the IHRA definition, the tweet can be seen as antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question states a ""fun fact"" regarding the use of certain tactics to keep European Jews out of the United States in the 1930s, drawing an analogy with Holocaust Remembrance Day. To determine if this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must evaluate it against their definition and guidelines.

1. **Discrimination or Hostility as a Core Element**: The tweet does not inherently express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. It merely references historical facts related to immigration policies affecting Jews in the 1930s.

2. **Essentialization or Negative Generalizations (Guideline A.1)**: The tweet does not essentialize Jews by attributing inherent negative traits to them; it discusses a historical policy without making sweeping generalizations about Jewish people.

3. **Linkage with Evil Forces (Guideline A.2)**: There is no indication that the tweet associates Jews with forces of evil, nor does it imply any conspiracy or hidden power attributed to ""the Jews.""

4. **Words, Visuals, and Deeds (Guideline A.3)**: The tweet contains neither antisemitic words nor visuals. It does not engage in antisemitic deeds either.

5. **Direct/Indirect, Explicit/Coded Speech (Guideline A.4)**: While the comparison made could be seen as contentious or provocative by some, it is framed as a historical fact and lacks explicit or coded antisemitic language. The tweet does not employ stereotypes or imagery associated with classical antisemitism.

6. **Denial/Minimization of Holocaust (Guideline A.5)**: The tweet does not deny or minimize the Holocaust; in fact, it mentions Holocaust Remembrance Day as a context for historical comparison.

7. **Israel and Palestine Context**: The tweet does not directly reference Israel-Palestine issues or employ antisemitic tropes associated with these topics.

8. **Contentious but Protected Speech (Guideline C.15)**: While the tweet might be seen as contentious, it falls under political speech that can express critical historical parallels without crossing into antisemitism according to JDA guidelines.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the tweet does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism. It is a statement of historical comparison rather than an expression of prejudice or hostility towards Jews.",1,0,1,0,0,0

This assessment is based on several elements:

1. **Connotation of Theft and Criminality**: The phrase ""they stole the land"" implies an illegitimate or criminal act committed by a group against Jewish people, which aligns with the IHRA example of making dehumanizing allegations about Jews as a collective.

2. **Stereotypical Allegations**: This statement can be seen as a stereotypical allegation that implicitly accuses a certain group (often inferred to be Muslims in this context) of criminal actions solely directed at Jews. Such statements reinforce negative and conspiratorial stereotypes about Jewish people being victimized by others, which is consistent with antisemitic rhetoric.

3. **Contextual Implication**: While the tweet does not explicitly identify who ""they"" are, the context often implies a historical or ongoing conflict related to Israel and Palestine. This can be viewed as attributing collective blame or negative actions towards Jews or Jewish collectives (such as the state of Israel), aligning with examples in the IHRA definition that involve blaming Jews for real or imagined wrongdoings.

Overall, while the tweet is brief and lacks specific context, its language fits within patterns described by the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. It implies a dehumanizing and conspiratorial view towards Jewish people in relation to land ownership and history.",No,"The tweet ""@BADRELBAZ1 After they stole the land from the Jews..."" on its own does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). To determine whether a statement is antisemitic, it must be evaluated in context and against specific guidelines outlined in the JDA.

1. **Contextual Analysis**: The tweet lacks sufficient context to assess its intent or target accurately. It does not specify who ""they"" refers to, nor does it provide additional information that might link it to antisemitic themes such as those mentioned in guideline 2 (e.g., portraying Jews as linked to evil forces).

2. **Guideline Evaluation**:
   - The tweet could potentially be interpreted as a historical reference to the displacement of Jewish communities from certain lands, particularly relevant to discussions surrounding Israel and Palestine.
   - It does not contain any elements that essentialize or generalize about Jews as inherently possessing negative traits (guideline 1).
   - There is no indication in this single sentence that it links Jews with evil forces or conspiracy theories (guideline 2).
   - The tweet lacks visual, verbal, or behavioral antisemitic content such as stereotypes or threats outlined in guideline 3.
   - It does not seem to be a coded statement equating Jewish people with undue power or control over global events (guideline 4).
   - There is no mention of the Holocaust, its denial, or minimization (guideline 5).

3. **Guidelines on Israel and Palestine**:
   - The tweet does not appear to apply negative stereotypes of classical antisemitism to the State of Israel (guideline 6) or hold Jews collectively responsible for any actions (guideline 7).
   - It does not demand that Jews publicly condemn Israel or Zionism (guideline 8), question their loyalty to their own countries (guideline 9), nor deny their right to exist and flourish in Israel (guideline 10).

Given the above analysis, without additional context suggesting an antisemitic intent or content, this tweet does not fall under the antisemitic definitions provided by the JDA.

This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews. Such language fits within the framework of attributing negative stereotypes and character traits to Jews collectively.

Additionally, by associating a group known for such rhetoric with an invitation from a prestigious and powerful institution like the White House, it could be argued that this lends legitimacy or acceptance to antisemitic views. While the tweet itself does not directly make antisemitic statements against individuals or groups of Jews, it highlights and potentially legitimizes the presence of an organization that propagates such views.

Therefore, given the content cited in the tweet regarding ""TruNews,"" which aligns with examples of antisemitism as defined by IHRA (such as dehumanizing language and stereotypes), the tweet can be considered to reference or validate antisemitic ideologies. Thus, it is appropriate to classify this scenario under the umbrella of promoting or being complicit in antisemitism according to the provided definition.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is specifically defined as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews because they are Jewish. The tweet in question does not directly target Jewish individuals or institutions with such negative actions but instead refers to an entity called ""TruNews"" that has engaged in hate speech, including statements targeting Jews.

The content of the tweet highlights and criticizes the White House's decision to invite a group known for spreading antisemitic rhetoric. It mentions specific examples of TruNews' previous hate speech, such as calling Jews ""deceivers,"" which aligns with guideline 3 of the JDA concerning antisemitic words. However, the tweet itself does not express antisemitism; rather, it condemns the presence and influence of a group that propagates antisemitic views.

In terms of guidelines:
- Guideline 1 stresses avoiding sweeping negative generalizations about Jews.
- Guideline 2 highlights classic antisemitic themes like Jews being linked to evil or conspiracies, which are actions attributed to TruNews but not the tweet itself.
- The tweet serves as a critique of a platform giving access to a group with known antisemitic views.

Therefore, while the tweet addresses an issue concerning antisemitism, it does so in a manner that opposes rather than endorses or perpetuates antisemitic sentiments. Thus, according to the JDA definition, the tweet itself is not antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

The tweet mentions the Second Crusade and notes that several hundred Jews were slain in various locations in France during this period. This reference is an acknowledgment of historical events rather than a direct expression of hatred or conspiracy against contemporary Jewish people. However, when evaluated through the lens of the IHRA definition, it can be considered antisemitic depending on context and intent.

1. **Historical Context**: The mention of Jews being slain during the Second Crusade aligns with known historical facts about violence directed at Jewish communities in medieval Europe. While accurate historically, such references can evoke painful memories of persecution that continue to affect perceptions of safety among Jewish communities today.

2. **Intent and Perception**: If the tweet intends or is perceived as invoking antisemitic stereotypes, such as portraying Jews as perennial victims or suggesting a continuing conspiratorial role of Jews throughout history, it could be seen as reinforcing negative characterizations.

3. **Conspiracy Implications**: Although not explicitly stated in this tweet, if similar statements are part of a larger pattern that attributes ongoing hostility to Jewish people without legitimate context (e.g., historical education), they might imply or reinforce conspiracy theories about Jewish behavior or existence throughout history.

4. **Contemporary Resonance**: The mention of past violence against Jews can resonate with contemporary antisemitic narratives, especially if it serves as a reminder of victimhood in a way that implicitly suggests vulnerability due to inherent qualities of the Jewish people.

5. **Double Standards and Comparisons**: If this historical reference is used selectively (e.g., not mentioning violence against other groups at the time), it might imply double standards, another element listed by IHRA.

In summary, while the tweet itself does not explicitly express hatred or stereotypes directed at contemporary Jews, its potential to evoke antisemitic sentiment depends heavily on context, intent, and how it is perceived within broader discussions. As such, it could be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition if these elements align with perpetuating negative Jewish stereotypes or suggesting ongoing conspiracies or victimization.",No,"The tweet refers to historical events during the Second Crusade in 1147, where several hundred Jews were slain in specific locations in France. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, this reference does not constitute antisemitism. Here’s why:

1. **Historical Context**: The tweet simply states a historical fact about events that took place during the Second Crusade without expressing any contemporary prejudice, discrimination, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. It does not involve generalizations or stereotypes about Jews.

2. **Absence of Modern Hostility or Prejudice**: There is no indication in the tweet of modern-day antisemitic sentiments such as portraying Jews with negative characteristics (e.g., greedy, unpatriotic) or attributing harmful intentions or actions to them collectively today.

3. **No Use of Antisemitic Imagery or Language**: The tweet does not use antisemitic symbols, images, or coded language that implies Jewish conspiracy theories or portrays Jews as embodying evil forces.

4. **Lack of Contemporary Condemnation or Hostility**: There is no direct or indirect condemnation or hostility toward contemporary Jewish individuals, communities, or institutions in the tweet. It neither calls for action against Jews today nor expresses hatred towards them.

5. **No Inference to Modern Context**: The tweet does not draw parallels between historical events and modern-day situations involving Jews or Israel that could be interpreted as antisemitic under the JDA guidelines.

Therefore, while discussing a tragic part of history, the content of this tweet does not meet any criteria for antisemitism as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism.

This assertion aligns with part of the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, which notes that one form of antisemitism involves holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the state of Israel.

The key issue here is the conflation of a political entity (the Israeli government) with an entire religious or ethnic group (Jews). Such generalizations can contribute to harmful stereotypes and perceptions that all Jewish people, regardless of their individual beliefs or affiliations, are uniformly accountable for the policies or actions of any single country's government.

According to the IHRA definition, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against other countries is not considered antisemitic. However, when such criticism extends into attributing collective responsibility to an entire group (Jews), it crosses a line into what can be classified as antisemitism under this framework. The tweet correctly identifies this conflation as ""blatant antisemitism,"" aligning with the IHRA's guidance that collectively blaming Jews for the actions of Israel is indeed a form of antisemitic expression.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews because they are Jewish. The tweet in question criticizes someone for conflating the actions of the Israeli government with all Jews, labeling this as ""blatant antisemitism."" 

This criticism is aligned with guideline 7 from section B of the JDA, which states that holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct or treating them simply because they are Jewish as agents of Israel constitutes antisemitism. By asserting that conflating the Israeli government's actions with all Jews is a form of antisemitism, the tweet itself does not engage in antisemitic behavior but rather calls out an action it identifies as such.

Therefore, the tweet reflects awareness and adherence to JDA guidelines by addressing what it views as a misuse of collective Jewish identity in political discourse. It aims to prevent the stereotyping or demonization of Jews based on actions attributed solely to Israeli government policy. As such, according to the criteria set forth in the JDA, the tweet is not antisemitic because it does not exhibit discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews; instead, it critiques an action that could contribute to such sentiments.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Here’s a breakdown of why this tweet is considered antisemitic:

1. **Implicit Bias and Stereotyping**: The statement ""More unhinged behavior by those who forgive violence against Jews"" implies a stereotype that certain groups or individuals are predisposed to condone or excuse acts of violence targeting Jewish people. This can perpetuate the notion that antisemitism, in some form, is accepted or overlooked within these groups, which may contribute to an environment where such prejudice goes unchallenged.

2. **Targeting a Group**: By specifically mentioning ""those who forgive violence against Jews,"" the tweet singles out a subset of people based on their perceived stance towards violence against Jews. This can be seen as targeting individuals or groups for not holding anti-Jewish violence accountable, thus indirectly supporting an environment where antisemitism could thrive.

3. **Context and Implication**: Although the tweet does not explicitly use derogatory language or make direct accusations against Jewish people, its implication that certain behaviors are expected (or forgiven) in relation to violence against Jews can foster harmful stereotypes. This aligns with the IHRA definition's point about antisemitism frequently charging Jews with being subjected to harm or conspiracies without justification.

4. **Encouragement of Division**: The tweet’s tone and content may encourage division by suggesting that forgiving violence is inherently ""unhinged,"" which could be interpreted as a call for increased scrutiny or hostility towards those who do not blame Jewish individuals or communities when such violence occurs. This contributes to the broader narrative of antisemitism where Jews are unfairly blamed or targeted.

In summary, while not overtly using classic antisemitic language or imagery, the tweet's implications and focus on forgiveness of violence against Jews align with several aspects of the IHRA definition of antisemitism, particularly in fostering harmful stereotypes and division. Therefore, it can be categorized as antisemitic.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must analyze its content against the definition and guidelines provided by the JDA.

1. **Definition of Antisemitism**: The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). For something to be considered antisemitic under this definition, it must explicitly target Jews due to their identity or Jewish institutions because they are Jewish.

2. **Content of the Tweet**: The tweet mentions ""unhinged behavior by those who forgive violence against Jews,"" alongside a link. The statement criticizes individuals for forgiving acts of violence against Jews rather than directly expressing hostility or prejudice towards Jews themselves. It does not generalize about Jews, attribute negative characteristics to them as a group, nor does it suggest that Jews are linked with evil forces.

3. **Guidelines Consideration**:
   - **General Guidelines**: The tweet does not essentialize Jews or make sweeping generalizations (guideline 1). It also does not depict Jews in stereotypical or harmful imagery (guideline 3).
   - **Israel and Palestine Specifics**: While some criticisms might involve complex political contexts, the statement does not apply classical antisemitic symbols or stereotypes to Israel (guidelines 6-10), nor does it collectively hold Jewish people responsible for political actions unrelated to their identity as Jews.

4. **Contextual Judgement**: The tweet appears to be addressing a specific behavior (forgiveness of violence against Jews) rather than making statements about Jews themselves. It may express frustration or disapproval towards those perceived as not adequately responding to violence against Jews, but it does not inherently convey antisemitism under the JDA's definition.

In conclusion, based on the content and context provided by this single tweet, there is no explicit indication of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence directed specifically at Jews due to their identity. Thus, according to the JDA criteria, the tweet is not considered antisemitic. However, without additional context about the link provided in the tweet, a comprehensive analysis could be limited. Nonetheless, based on the text alone, it does not meet the definition of antisemitism as per the JDA guidelines.",1,0,1,0,0,0

The message suggests that there is an underlying, unacknowledged hatred toward Jews that should be openly expressed rather than implied or avoided (""stop pussyfootin’""). This aligns with the IHRA's description of antisemitism as a certain perception of Jews which can manifest as hatred.

The request to ""just say you hate Jews already"" implies an encouragement of expressing antisemitic sentiments, which supports the propagation of such views. Even if not overtly hostile or violent in nature within this specific tweet, it promotes and normalizes expressing hatred toward Jewish people. This kind of rhetoric contributes to a broader environment where antisemitism can flourish by suggesting that such feelings are acceptable or should be openly acknowledged.

Therefore, while the tweet does not directly engage in acts like making dehumanizing allegations, denying historical facts about the Holocaust, or applying double standards to Israel, it encourages the expression of hatred toward Jews, fitting within the broader understanding of antisemitism as outlined by the IHRA.",No,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews specifically as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet in question does not explicitly express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against an individual's identity as a Jew or towards Jewish institutions. It is a statement urging the person being addressed to openly admit their dislike for Jews.

However, this type of encouragement can contribute to a hostile environment or be part of a broader pattern that might be considered antisemitic in context. The tweet does not contain direct hate speech but instead challenges someone to express their prejudice more candidly. Without additional context—such as the ongoing conversation's tone, history, and intent—it is difficult to definitively classify this specific statement as antisemitic under the JDA guidelines.

Specifically, the tweet criticizes a law that grants quick citizenship to Jews fleeing persecution from the USSR by comparing it unfavorably with how it perceives actions regarding Indian immigrants (""Indus""). The implication here is that there is preferential treatment towards Jewish individuals over others, which aligns with the IHRA definition of applying double standards ""by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.""

Additionally, the tweet suggests involvement of a ""Pak lobby,"" invoking stereotypes about political influence and decision-making being controlled by minority groups. This can be interpreted as employing dehumanizing rhetoric that mirrors the antisemitic stereotype mentioned in the IHRA definition where Jews are accused of having disproportionate power or control (""e.g., the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy""). The tweet's tone dismisses serious humanitarian considerations for granting asylum to persecuted individuals, framing it instead as a joke and suggesting ulterior motives tied to ethnic or religious identity.

In summary, the combination of applying double standards specific to Jews in policy-making and invoking stereotypes of undue influence aligns with examples provided by the IHRA working definition of antisemitism.

As per guideline 15, political speech that some may see as contentious or reflecting a ""double standard"" is not inherently antisemitic.

2. **No Use of Antisemitic Themes**: The tweet does not employ the symbols, images, or stereotypes associated with classic antisemitism (Guideline 6). It doesn't attribute any inherent negative characteristics to Jews nor does it portray them as linked to evil forces (Guideline 2).

4. **Lack of Holocaust Denial or Minimization**: The tweet does not deny or minimize the Holocaust in any way (Guideline 5).

In summary, while the tweet may be seen as critical of U.S. policies and could potentially reflect biases against lobbying influences, it does not meet the criteria outlined in the JDA for antisemitism.

1. **Scapegoating Jews**: The phrase ""Leftist MSM Must scapegoat eh? 1st Jews.."" suggests a pattern of blaming or targeting Jews, which aligns with the notion of assigning collective blame to Jews for broader societal issues. This can be seen as akin to the antisemitic stereotype that charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity.

2. **Demonization**: The tweet implies an ongoing effort by the ""Left"" to undermine civilization and links this disintegration to actions against both Jews and Christians, which may dehumanize or demonize groups perceived to be targeted by leftist media (""MSM""). This type of rhetoric echoes antisemitic themes that accuse Jews of being responsible for societal problems.

3. **Conspiracy Mentions**: The tweet subtly suggests a conspiracy involving the Left and the media (termed ""MSM"" here) in scapegoating or targeting groups, which resonates with the antisemitic idea of attributing harmful actions to Jewish influence over media or government, even if not explicitly stated.

4. **Historical Patterns**: By referencing Jews first and then Christians as targets for scapegoating, it invokes historical patterns where such accusations have been used against Jews. This can indirectly reinforce stereotypes by implying that Jews are habitual scapegoats in societal or political narratives.

2. **Linkage to Evil**: There is no indication in the tweet that links Jews to evil forces or conspiracy theories that suggest hidden power or control over societal structures like governments or media.

3. **Manifestation of Words and Deeds**: The tweet lacks explicit antisemitic language, images, or actions against Jews. It does not depict Jews with negative stereotypes or suggest hostile deeds toward Jewish individuals or institutions.

4. **Direct or Coded Language**: The tweet's content is vague regarding specific groups or entities it refers to as scapegoats and does not employ coded language that directly targets Jews through historical antisemitic tropes or conspiracy theories.

5. **Holocaust Denial**: There is no mention of the Holocaust, nor any attempt to deny or minimize its occurrence, which would be explicitly antisemitic according to the JDA.

6. **Israel and Palestine Context**: The tweet does not specifically address issues related to Israel and Palestine in a manner that would align with the antisemitic examples provided by the JDA. It lacks statements attributing collective responsibility to Jews for the actions of the Israeli state or questioning their right to exist as a people.

7. **Non-Antisemitic Context**: While critical of what it perceives as scapegoating, the tweet does not engage in activities like boycotts, divestment, or sanctions against Israel that are explicitly mentioned in the JDA as non-antisemitic actions when appropriately directed at state policies rather than Jewish people.

In conclusion, while the language used might suggest a general dissatisfaction with political narratives and could potentially be interpreted in various ways depending on context not provided here, it does not meet the specific criteria outlined by the JDA for antisemitism.

1. **Negative Stereotyping**: The tweet suggests that Israeli actions (killing Folke Bernadotte) were driven by motivations inconsistent with the portrayal of Jews as morally responsible or humane, especially given Bernadotte's history of saving Jews during World War II.

2. **Double Standards and Demonization**: By highlighting a negative action of Israelis while referencing their refusal to accept a peace deal proposed by someone who saved Jews, it may imply that Israeli actions are more condemnable than those of other nations or groups in similar situations, thereby applying a double standard.

3. **Historical Denial/Minimization**: The tweet subtly implies an anti-Jewish sentiment by focusing on the negative aspect (killing Bernadotte) without acknowledging the broader historical and geopolitical context, which may resonate with denying Jewish suffering or heroism during World War II.

1. **Direct Hostility or Discrimination Against Jews as Jews:** The tweet criticizes Israeli actions regarding a historical event involving Folke Bernadotte, focusing on Israel rather than targeting Jews as an ethnic group or implying any stereotypes about Jewish people.

2. **Essentializing or Negative Generalizations About Jews:** There is no essentializing of Jewish character traits or sweeping negative generalizations made about Jews in the tweet. The criticism is specific to a historical event involving the Israeli state, not Jewish individuals or communities globally.

3. **Linking Jews with Evil:** The tweet does not link Jews as a group with evil forces or conspiracy theories. Instead, it criticizes a decision made by the Israeli government at that time regarding Bernadotte's peace plan.

4. **Coded Language Against Jews:** There is no coded language suggesting negative stereotypes or myths about Jewish people, such as hidden control over global affairs or insinuations of disloyalty among non-Israeli Jews.

5. **Denial of Holocaust:** The tweet does not deny or minimize the Holocaust, which is a specific antisemitic act according to JDA guidelines 5.

6. **Collective Responsibility and Condemnation:** It does not hold all Jewish people collectively responsible for Israel's actions nor demands that Jews condemn Zionism or Israeli policies in any form.

7. **Denial of Existence of the State of Israel:** The tweet does not deny the right of Jews to exist and flourish in Israel.

8. **Criticism Related to Specific Policies:** Criticism, even if harsh, is directed at historical political actions rather than Jewish individuals or communities as a whole.

9. **Boycotts, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS):** The tweet does not advocate for BDS against Israel, nor does it use that platform to indirectly target Jews globally.

10. **Political Speech:** While the content might be contentious, the JDA guidelines emphasize that political speech critical of a state is protected as long as it doesn't cross into antisemitic territory. This tweet falls under criticism of past Israeli policy decisions without crossing those boundaries.

Therefore, based on these analyses aligned with the JDA's definition and guidelines, the tweet does not qualify as antisemitic. It focuses on criticizing specific historical political actions by Israel rather than targeting Jews as an ethnic or religious group.",1,0,1,0,0,0
1222374914931470336,RAGING_RABBI,2020-01-29 04:24:25+00:00,0,Jews,@JoeBiden The PA never wanted to sit at the table..\n\nYour administration said Jews have no history to Jerusalem. \n\nWhat have you done for the Jews in Israel or Palestinians. \n\nYou've been in gov for 40 years and done nothing.,Yes,"The tweet contains elements that can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, particularly in its targeting of Jewish people and Israel. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Misrepresentation of Historical Facts**: The tweet claims that ""Your administration said Jews have no history to Jerusalem."" This statement is factually incorrect as Jews have a long-standing historical connection to Jerusalem, which is deeply rooted in religious, cultural, and historical contexts. Misrepresenting or denying this connection can be seen as an attempt to undermine the Jewish people's legitimate ties to their ancestral homeland.

2. **Criticism of Israel**: The tweet criticizes the administration for its stance on Israel by suggesting that it denies Jews a historical claim to Jerusalem. While criticism of any country, including Israel, is not inherently antisemitic, in this context, it aligns with examples listed in the IHRA definition where the actions or existence of Israel are delegitimized. Specifically, it could be seen as part of ""denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination"" and applying a double standard by questioning Israel's historical claims without similar scrutiny applied to other nations.

3. **Collective Blame**: The tweet questions what has been done for Jews in Israel, which may imply a collective responsibility or expectation placed on political figures regarding Jewish affairs. This can be interpreted as holding leaders accountable for the welfare of Jews globally, reflecting an outdated and harmful perception where individual Jews are seen through the lens of their collective identity.

4. **Contextual Implications**: The broader context of criticism towards the administration's handling of Israeli-Palestinian relations may exacerbate existing tensions and prejudices. By framing the narrative in a way that suggests negligence or hostility toward Jewish interests, it can contribute to an environment where antisemitic sentiments are fostered.

Overall, while not every element of the tweet is overtly antisemitic on its own, when considered together within the framework provided by the IHRA definition, these points suggest an underlying bias that aligns with certain manifestations of antisemitism.",No,"To determine if the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to examine its content against the provided definition and guidelines.

1. **Definition Analysis**:
   - The core of the JDA definition focuses on discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence specifically directed at Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish.
   - The tweet criticizes U.S. policy regarding Jerusalem and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but does not explicitly target Jews or Jewish individuals or institutions in a discriminatory manner.

2. **Guidelines Analysis**:
   - **General Guidelines (A)**: There are no sweeping negative generalizations about Jews, nor is there an essentialization of Jews as linked to evil forces or conspiracies.
   - The tweet references political decisions and actions related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but does not employ antisemitic symbols, images, or stereotypes.

3. **Israel and Palestine Specific Guidelines (B)**:
   - The tweet mentions Jerusalem, a central point in the Israel-Palestine debate, yet it avoids attributing actions or policies of the state of Israel to Jewish people as individuals.
   - It criticizes a policy decision purportedly made by Joe Biden's administration regarding Jerusalem but does not equate this with collective blame on Jews (as outlined in guideline 7).

4. **Non-Antisemitic Examples (C)**:
   - The tweet reflects criticism of political actions related to Israel, which falls under the non-antisemitic category according to guidelines such as 11 and 13 that allow for evidence-based criticism of a state's policies without being inherently antisemitic.
   - It questions policy decisions but does not demand Jews individually condemn these actions or imply they should be treated differently due to their Jewish identity.

In conclusion, while the tweet critiques U.S. foreign policy towards Israel and Palestine, it does not engage in language or behavior that discriminates against or targets Jews as individuals or Jewish institutions specifically as Jewish. Therefore, according to the JDA's definition and guidelines, the tweet is not antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

The Tree of Life Synagogue shooter killed 11 people, motivated by Soros conspiracy theories. Report to Twitter.\nhttps://t.co/RoQmeus5MS",Yes,"According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, several elements in the tweet align with behaviors and expressions considered antisemitic. The reference to ""antisemitic conspiracy theories"" suggests that these are being propagated by Bill Mitchell on Yom HaShoah, a day dedicated to remembering those killed during the Holocaust. This context is significant because it highlights an intentional targeting of Jewish people or symbols, especially given that the tweet mentions this event.

Moreover, the mention of ""Soros conspiracy theories"" aligns with the IHRA definition by referencing a common antisemitic trope: the idea of Jews controlling various societal institutions, such as media and politics. This stereotype is one of those described in the IHRA examples, where allegations are made about Jewish individuals or collectives manipulating events or holding undue influence.

The tweet also draws attention to the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting, noting that the perpetrator was motivated by ""Soros conspiracy theories."" By linking this tragic event to such antisemitic narratives, the tweet underscores a dangerous real-world consequence of these ideologies—violence against Jewish people and institutions. This connection reinforces the notion of harmful stereotypes being used as justification for physical attacks.

Therefore, by promoting and highlighting these antisemitic ideas, the tweet contributes to the spread of hatred towards Jews through rhetoric that involves conspiracy theories targeting Jewish individuals or symbols, which falls under the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",No,"**

The tweet in question accuses Bill Mitchell of tweeting antisemitic conspiracy theories on Yom HaShoah, a day dedicated to remembering the Holocaust. It specifically mentions that the Tree of Life Synagogue shooter was motivated by Soros conspiracy theories, which are often associated with antisemitism due to their portrayal of Jewish individuals as having undue influence or power.

According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines:

1. **Guideline 2** highlights the problematic nature of attributing negative actions or characteristics to Jews collectively and points out that conspiracy theories about a Jewish global control are antisemitic.

2. **Guideline 5** states that denying or minimizing the Holocaust is antisemitic, but the tweet does not engage in this behavior; rather, it references the Holocaust as part of its argument against spreading such conspiracy theories.

3. The tweet itself does not promote or support these conspiracy theories. Instead, it criticizes them and suggests reporting Bill Mitchell's actions to Twitter for promoting such views on a significant day like Yom HaShoah.

Thus, while the content described in the tweet (Soros conspiracy theories) aligns with antisemitic themes as defined by the JDA, the tweet itself is not perpetuating these ideas. It criticizes and calls out antisemitism rather than endorsing it. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines, this tweet would not be considered antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

We have muslims in Brooklyn also to many illigals,jews do not harm anyone let it be jobs are everywhere!",Yes,"The tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition due to several reasons:

1. **Stereotyping and Generalization**: The statement generalizes that ""jews do not harm anyone,"" which, while seemingly positive, contributes to a narrative where Jews are expected to behave in a certain way (harmlessly) compared to other groups. This can perpetuate stereotypes by implying that it's unusual or noteworthy for Jews to be associated with harm, indirectly feeding into antisemitic narratives by contrasting Jewish behavior against perceived negative behaviors of others.

2. **Context of Blame**: The tweet suggests that there is a specific reason why ""Blacks are mad at jews in Brooklyn,"" which is attributed to the presence of Muslims and illegal immigrants rather than addressing any specific actions or behaviors by Jews themselves. This implies an unwarranted collective responsibility or negative perception directed towards Jewish people, echoing the IHRA's point about antisemitism when it involves blaming a group for broader societal issues.

3. **Provoking Tension**: By highlighting tensions between Blacks and Jews in Brooklyn without context or resolution, it potentially exacerbates divisions and stereotypes. This kind of rhetoric can fuel misunderstandings and hostility among communities, fitting within the IHRA's framework where antisemitism is expressed through speech that fosters negative perceptions of Jews.

4. **Omission of Responsibility**: The tweet absolves Jewish people from any involvement in societal issues or conflicts, which can be interpreted as an attempt to deflect responsibility away from individuals' actions and onto group identity. This aligns with the IHRA's mention of antisemitism when it involves accusations against a collective based on the actions of a few.

In summary, while not overtly hostile, the tweet subtly employs stereotypes, implies unwarranted blame towards Jews for societal tensions, and contributes to negative perceptions, fitting within several aspects of the IHRA's definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question does not clearly fall under the JDA's definition of antisemitism, although it does raise some concerns that require careful interpretation. Let's analyze the tweet based on the provided guidelines:

1. **General Context and Language**:
   - The tweet mentions ""Blacks are mad at Jews in Brooklyn,"" without providing a specific reason for this sentiment. It attempts to rationalize this by contrasting Jewish presence with ""muslims"" and ""illegal immigrants,"" suggesting that Jews do not contribute to negative issues like job scarcity.
   
2. **Linkage Between Jews and Evil**:
   - The tweet does not associate Jews with evil or conspiratorial behavior, which is a key element in classic antisemitism as outlined in guideline 2.

3. **Words, Visual Images, and Deeds**:
   - There are no direct derogatory words, images, or suggested actions against Jews within the tweet. It neither depicts Jews negatively nor suggests any form of violence or discrimination against them (guideline 3).

4. **Directness or Indirect Coded Messages**:
   - The language used is not coded in a manner that directly implies inherent negative traits about Jews or positions them as harmful to society. It attempts to argue that Jewish presence does not contribute negatively, which can be seen as neutral or even positive in intent (guideline 4).

5. **Holocaust Denial**:
   - There is no mention of the Holocaust or any attempt to deny or minimize it.

6. **Israel and Palestine Context**:
   - The tweet does not reference Israel directly nor uses symbols, images, or stereotypes associated with classical antisemitism in relation to Israel (guidelines 6-10).

7. **Support for Palestinian Rights**:
   - The content is unrelated to support for Palestinian rights or criticism of Israeli policies, so it doesn't fall under guidelines that are explicitly not considered antisemitic in the context of Israel and Palestine (guidelines 11-15).

While the tweet uses divisive language by comparing different ethnic groups in Brooklyn, it does not explicitly express hostility towards Jews. It attempts to justify why ""Blacks"" might be upset with Jews without attributing any malicious intent or stereotypes specifically linked to antisemitism as per the JDA guidelines. Therefore, based solely on these criteria, the tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the JDA definition.

However, it's important to note that while the tweet may not meet the threshold for antisemitism under this framework, its divisive nature could still contribute to inter-community tensions and should be approached with sensitivity in broader discussions.",1,0,1,0,0,0

This description aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism in several ways:

1. **Perception and Expression**: The reference to the Imam preaching about Jews implies a negative perception directed toward Jewish individuals or communities. If the speech includes derogatory, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations, it could fit within the antisemitic examples provided by the IHRA.

2. **Mendacious Allegations**: Without further context from the video itself, if the preacher makes ""mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical"" claims about Jews (such as conspiracy theories), this would be consistent with antisemitism according to the IHRA definition.

3. **Incitement and Harm**: The tweet implies that the content might incite negative views against Jews by associating them with other controversial topics like gays and coronavirus in a possibly defamatory context, which aligns with manifestations of hatred or hostility toward Jewish individuals or their beliefs.

4. **Public Life and Media**: By publicizing the video (even indirectly through criticism), the tweet contributes to spreading potentially antisemitic rhetoric if the original content includes such elements, highlighting its relevance to public life and media representations outlined in the IHRA examples.

Without access to the actual content of the Imam's speech, the decision is based on how the description aligns with potential manifestations of antisemitism as per the provided definition. The tweet suggests a scenario where Jews are being negatively depicted, which fulfills aspects of the IHRA’s criteria for antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet itself does not directly provide enough context or content to classify it as antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines. It mentions a video related to an Imam's preaching about ""gays, Jews, and coronavirus,"" but the tweet does not include specific content from that speech nor attributes any discriminatory, prejudiced, hostile, or violent sentiments against Jews or Jewish institutions directly.

The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). It also describes how antisemitism can manifest through words, visual images, and deeds that promote negative stereotypes or hostilities towards Jews. In the tweet's case:

1. **Lack of Direct Evidence**: The tweet does not provide explicit examples of speech content from the video itself; therefore, it cannot be definitively assessed whether the Imam's speech included antisemitic elements as defined by JDA.

2. **Potential Contextual Interpretation**: While mentioning ""Jews"" in a tweet linked with negative events (like coronavirus) could raise suspicions of coded language or indirect prejudice, without specific evidence from the content referenced, it remains speculative to label the tweet as outright antisemitic.

3. **Call for Review by Authority**: The suggestion that @NYGovCuomo might want to ""take a peak"" into the video implies concern but does not itself express an antisemitic viewpoint; rather, it calls for action or scrutiny.

4. **Reference to MEMRIReports**: While the tweet credits @MEMRIReports (a monitoring service known for analyzing Middle Eastern media), this reference alone does not determine the nature of the content without further insight into what is being reported on in the video.

In conclusion, based solely on the text of the tweet and absent specific content from the mentioned video, it cannot be decisively determined as antisemitic according to JDA guidelines. Further examination of the actual speech within the video would be necessary for a thorough assessment.",1,0,1,0,0,0

To determine whether this is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we need to analyze several key elements:

1. **Historical Context**: The tweet references a historical fact about discrimination against Jews but implies it might be repeated or justified currently. This can evoke harmful stereotypes that suggest conspiracies or discriminatory actions are inherently tied to Jewish identity.

2. **Potential Implications**: By drawing a direct parallel between past exclusionary tactics and contemporary practices during Holocaust Remembrance Day, the tweet risks trivializing the historical persecution of Jews and suggests an ongoing conspiracy against them, which aligns with one aspect of antisemitism in the IHRA definition—attributing negative stereotypes or actions to Jews as a collective.

3. **Double Standards**: If the comparison implies that Israel or Jewish people are held to different standards than other nations or groups (e.g., being unfairly criticized during Holocaust Remembrance Day), it could be seen as applying double standards, another criterion in the IHRA definition of antisemitism.

4. **Intent and Interpretation**: While not explicitly stated, if the tweet can be interpreted as suggesting that actions similar to those historically used against Jews are still appropriate or justified today, it would further align with patterns of antisemitic rhetoric.

In conclusion, based on the potential for the message to invoke harmful stereotypes, imply a conspiracy, or apply double standards, this tweet could reasonably be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition.",No,"**

The tweet references a historical tactic used to restrict European Jews from entering the United States in the 1930s, coinciding with Holocaust Remembrance Day. To assess whether this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must consider the guidelines provided.

1. **Historical Context and Factuality**: The tweet refers to a historical fact about immigration policies during the 1930s, which aligns with well-documented historical events. This context does not inherently convey antisemitic sentiment as it is addressing historical discrimination rather than promoting hatred or prejudice against Jews today.

2. **Denial of Holocaust (Guideline 5)**: The tweet does not deny or minimize the Holocaust in any way. It references a tactic from history, which does not involve disputing the occurrence or severity of the Holocaust itself.

3. **General Guidelines on Antisemitism**: According to Guideline 1, essentializing Jews as inherently possessing negative traits is antisemitic. This tweet does not generalize about Jewish people in such a manner; rather, it discusses historical policies affecting Jews without attributing any inherent characteristics or conspiracy to them.

4. **Context of Critique and Memory (Guidelines 11-15)**: The context of the tweet is Holocaust Remembrance Day, which implies an intent to reflect on historical injustices faced by Jewish people. It does not employ symbols, images, or stereotypes from classical antisemitism, nor does it hold Jews collectively responsible for any negative outcomes.

5. **Political Speech and Historical Criticism**: The JDA acknowledges that evidence-based criticism of historical events involving Jews is not inherently antisemitic (Guideline 13). The tweet's reference to immigration policies falls under this category as a historical observation rather than an attack on Jewish people or Israel.

Overall, the tweet does not meet any criteria for antisemitism according to the JDA definition.

By people like you, that spoke your language and lived in your cities.\n\nNazi Germany was Nazi, but it was also Germany. https://t.co/FPmowYyYzI",Yes,"The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, primarily because it engages with themes that resonate with several outlined manifestations of contemporary antisemitism. The statement ""41% of Germans say Jews talk about the Holocaust too much"" indirectly supports a sentiment that criticizes Jewish people for focusing on the Holocaust and can contribute to a broader narrative that suggests Jews are overly sensitive or exaggerated in their responses to historical suffering. This aligns with the IHRA definition where criticism is levied against Jews collectively, which could be seen as an indirect accusation.

Moreover, by highlighting that ""Nazi Germany was Nazi, but it was also Germany,"" the tweet can unintentionally lend weight to a perspective known as Holocaust relativization or trivialization. While the intention might not be explicitly antisemitic, this phrasing can contribute to minimizing the distinct and extreme nature of Nazi ideology and its catastrophic impact on Jews specifically, which could feed into narratives that deny the unique severity of the genocide against the Jewish people—a point specifically covered under the IHRA's definition regarding Holocaust denial or minimization.

Additionally, while the tweet also provides a counterpoint by acknowledging personal Jewish identity and referencing historical facts about the Holocaust, it is the initial framing and potential interpretation that make it align with antisemitic sentiments. Given these considerations within the context of contemporary expressions of antisemitism as outlined by IHRA, this tweet can be seen as engaging in harmful rhetoric against Jews.",No,"DECISION: No

EXPLICATION:

The tweet in question states that ""41% of Germans say Jews talk about the Holocaust too much,"" and then provides personal context by identifying as Jewish and referencing the historical fact of six million Jews being murdered by Nazi Germany. The content and tone of this message should be analyzed within the guidelines provided by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA).

1. **Guideline Relevance**: 
   - According to guideline 5, denying or minimizing the Holocaust is considered antisemitic. However, the tweet does not deny, minimize, or trivialize the Holocaust; rather, it acknowledges and references the historical reality of the genocide.
   - Guideline 6 concerns applying negative stereotypes about Jews as a whole to Israel, which is not relevant here as this tweet does not make any reference to Israel.

2. **Content Analysis**: 
   - The tweet appears to be an expression of personal experience or frustration related to how Jewish history and trauma are perceived in contemporary discussions. It uses the statistic about Germans' opinions as a starting point for sharing personal identity and historical context.
   - By stating, ""I'm Jewish, so might as well live up to the expectations,"" it seems to counteract any implication that Jews talk excessively by affirming their own experience and history.
   - The tweet emphasizes that Nazi Germany was both ""Nazi"" and ""Germany,"" potentially aiming to highlight personal connection to German identity while acknowledging historical atrocities.

3. **Intent and Impact**: 
   - There is no language in the tweet that implies hatred, prejudice, or hostility against Jews as Jews, nor does it suggest any negative generalization about Jewish people.
   - The statement may be provocative or contentious, but according to guideline 15, being excessive or reflecting a ""double standard"" does not, in itself, constitute antisemitism.

By mentioning ""this was the same tactic used to keep European Jews out of the United States in the 1930s,"" the tweet may imply an equivalence between current actions and past discriminatory practices against Jews. This could be interpreted as employing negative character traits or sinister stereotypes, suggesting a conspiracy or coordinated effort involving Jewish people historically.

The IHRA definition emphasizes that antisemitism involves certain perceptions of Jews expressed through speech, writing, visual forms, or action. The tweet's mention of tactics used in the 1930s could be seen as an attempt to draw a parallel between past and present scenarios in a manner that insinuates a Jewish conspiracy or collective blame, which is listed as an example of antisemitic behavior.

While criticism of policies or actions related to Israel is not inherently antisemitic, if such criticisms are framed in ways that rely on stereotypes or historical prejudices against Jews, they can cross into the realm of antisemitism. The tweet's reference could be perceived as perpetuating a narrative about Jewish people that aligns with conspiratorial or demonizing allegations.

Without additional context from the linked material, it is challenging to fully assess the intent behind the tweet. However, based on the information provided and applying the IHRA definition, the content of the tweet can reasonably be interpreted as antisemitic because it potentially uses historical antisemitic stereotypes to make a point about contemporary events or policies.",No,"To determine if the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to assess it against the definition and guidelines provided.

1. **Definition Check**: The tweet does not express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. It references a historical tactic used to restrict European Jews from entering the United States in the 1930s but does not target contemporary Jews or Jewish communities with hate or bias.

2. **Guideline Consideration**:
   - The tweet does not make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews (guideline A1).
   - It does not associate Jews with evil forces, conspiracy theories, or hidden power structures (guideline A2).
   - There are no words, images, or deeds in the tweet that depict Jews negatively or incite harm against them (guideline A3).
   - The message is neither direct nor coded antisemitism; it does not use language suggestive of antisemitic ideas about Jewish control or conspiracy (guidelines A4 and A5).

3. **Contextual Analysis**: If the tweet refers to a legitimate historical fact regarding immigration policies without contemporary bias against Jews, it is informative rather than harmful.

4. **Comparison with B and C Guidelines**:
   - The tweet does not relate to Israel or Palestine in a way that applies stereotypes or blames Jewish individuals for state actions (guidelines B6-B10).
   - It aligns more closely with guideline C11-15 as it could be seen as discussing historical contexts relevant to Jewish history without negative implications.

Specifically, the statement suggests that Jewish voters are manipulated or influenced for political gain through nepotism (""bringing 43 Jews from Ethiopia to 'win votes of their families in election'""). This can be seen as an application of a stereotype that portrays Jews as collectively engaging in manipulative or dishonest behaviors to further their interests, which falls under the category of ""mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such.""

Additionally, this tweet could contribute to perceptions of Jewish people as having undue influence or power within political systems, potentially feeding into conspiracy theories that Jews control or disproportionately affect electoral outcomes. This type of narrative is reminiscent of the IHRA's warning against blaming Jews for societal or political issues and can perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

Therefore, considering these aspects in line with the IHRA definition, the tweet exhibits elements that could be perceived as antisemitic by fostering negative stereotypes about Jewish people collectively influencing politics for personal gain.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. The tweet in question states that ""Likud brings 43 Jews from Ethiopia to 'win votes of their families in election'."" This statement implies a political strategy targeting Jewish voters with Ethiopian heritage.

To determine if this is antisemitic under the JDA guidelines, we need to consider:

1. **Essentializing or Negative Generalizations (Guideline A.1):** The tweet does not essentialize Jews by attributing inherent negative traits but rather describes an alleged political tactic. It doesn’t claim that all Ethiopian Jews are a certain way; instead, it discusses a specific political action.

2. **Linking Jews to Evil (Guideline A.2):** The tweet does not suggest any nefarious or evil motives tied inherently to Jewish people or link them with broader conspiracies. It focuses on a particular instance related to electoral strategy.

3. **Manifestation in Words, Images, and Deeds (Guideline A.3):** The language used doesn't employ antisemitic stereotypes or imagery. It discusses an action purportedly taken by a political party, not derogatory statements about Jewish people as a whole.

4. **Direct or Indirect Antisemitism (Guideline A.4):** There is no coded or explicit antisemitic message in the tweet. It reports on perceived political actions without making broader negative generalizations about Jews or attributing them with hidden powers or collective agendas.

5. **Collective Responsibility and Agency (Guidelines B.6-B.9):** The tweet does not imply that all Jewish people are responsible for Israel's conduct, nor does it demand any action from Jews based on their identity. It references an electoral strategy involving a specific group without attributing broader responsibility to the entire Jewish population.

In conclusion, while the tweet might be criticized as politically biased or unfair if perceived as exploiting ethnic voters, it doesn't meet the JDA definition of antisemitism since it lacks elements of prejudice, discrimination, hostility, or linking Jews with evil. Therefore, based on these guidelines, the tweet is not considered antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

The content of the tweet describes a historical event where all Jews in a village were slaughtered, except for one baby spared by a Nazi soldier. This portrayal could be seen as employing sinister stereotypes and negative character traits, which are part of the manifestations of antisemitism outlined by the IHRA.

1. **Use of Stereotypes**: The narrative might reinforce harmful stereotypes about Jews being victims of constant persecution or violence, which is one aspect highlighted in the definition under ""manifestations.""

2. **Emotional Impact and Perpetuation of Victimhood**: By focusing on a graphic historical event involving Nazis, the tweet could evoke strong emotions and perpetuate a singular narrative of Jewish victimhood without broader context.

3. **Potential for Provocation**: The description of such an event can be seen as provocative or inflammatory in certain contexts, especially if it is used to elicit a particular response from those with antisemitic tendencies or to spread hate rather than educational awareness.

4. **Context Matters**: While the tweet might aim to educate or commemorate historical events, without additional context, it could be perceived as contributing to an environment where Jews are primarily viewed through the lens of victimhood in relation to Nazi violence, which aligns with some of the examples given for antisemitic rhetoric.

Overall, while the intent behind the tweet isn't clear and might not necessarily be antisemitic, its content fits several criteria within the IHRA definition that could lead it to be perceived as such. The key factor here is how audiences interpret the message and whether it reinforces harmful stereotypes or contributes to a hostile environment against Jews.",No,"The tweet describes a historical event where Jews were victims of violence during the Holocaust, specifically mentioning that ""all Jews in this village were slaughtered"" and highlighting an incident where a Jewish baby was spared by a Nazi soldier.

In this context, the tweet does not display any form of antisemitic content such as prejudice, hostility, or generalization about Jews. Instead, it recounts a specific historical event where Jews were subjected to extreme violence, which aligns with acknowledging and remembering the Holocaust rather than denying or minimizing it (as stated in guideline 5). Additionally, this tweet does not apply any negative stereotypes associated with classical antisemitism nor does it portray Jews as responsible for wrongdoing.

This aligns with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes making mendacious or demonizing allegations about Jews as a collective group. By associating BLM, an organization primarily focused on racial justice, with hatred towards Jews without evidence, the tweet contributes to harmful stereotypes and false narratives that can be perceived as antisemitic.

Furthermore, the suggestion that funding BLM equates to supporting anti-Jewish sentiment falls under the category of spreading conspiracy theories or demonizing claims about Jewish control or influence. This type of rhetoric mirrors examples in the IHRA definition that involve attributing negative characteristics or actions to Jews collectively without basis, which is a form of antisemitism.

Therefore, by promoting unfounded and harmful stereotypes linking BLM with anti-Jewish sentiments, the tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA working definition.",No,"The tweet in question mentions Sony funding Black Lives Matter (BLM) and implies that BLM ""hates Jews."" To determine if this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to assess whether it meets any of the criteria outlined in the definition and guidelines.

1. **General Criteria for Antisemitism**: The tweet does not inherently express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish. It merely makes a claim about BLM's views without expressing direct hatred or animosity toward Jews or Judaism itself.

2. **Essentializing or Negative Generalizations (Guideline 1)**: The tweet does not essentialize Jews by attributing negative traits to them inherently. It discusses an alleged stance of the BLM movement, not characteristics of Jewish people.

3. **Jews Linked to Evil (Guideline 2)**: There is no suggestion in the tweet that links Jews or Judaism with evil forces or conspiracy theories typical of antisemitism as described by the JDA.

4. **Manifestation through Words/Deeds (Guideline 3)**: The tweet does not use antisemitic words or imagery, nor does it suggest any deeds against Jewish people or institutions. It mentions a claim about BLM's stance without engaging in stereotypical or harmful depictions of Jews.

5. **Direct or Coded Antisemitism (Guideline 4)**: The statement is neither directly antisemitic nor coded in a way that would imply hidden negative meanings toward Jews. It discusses an organization’s alleged views rather than Jewish people per se.

6. **Holocaust Denial (Guideline 5)**: There is no mention or denial of the Holocaust, which is specifically identified as antisemitic by the JDA guidelines.

7. **Israel and Palestine Context**: The tweet does not relate to Israel, Zionism, or Palestinian rights, so Guidelines B and C are not applicable in this context.

In summary, while the tweet may be contentious or offensive depending on one's perspective, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It discusses a claim about an organization's views rather than expressing hostility towards Jews or Jewish institutions directly. Therefore, based on the information provided and according to the JDA guidelines, this tweet is not classified as antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

This implies a perception of special treatment or bias in dealing with issues related to Jews, which aligns with certain aspects of the IHRA definition of antisemitism.

Specifically, it reflects a form of discrimination by implying that actions against Jews might be handled differently than those against other groups. The tweet also underscores an underlying narrative common in antisemitic rhetoric: that there is excessive sensitivity or special consideration given to Jewish concerns, which could contribute to the perception of Jews conspiring to manipulate societal norms for their benefit.

Furthermore, this kind of statement can indirectly perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce negative perceptions about how issues concerning Jews are addressed by authorities or platforms, thus aligning with elements from the IHRA definition that mention blaming Jews collectively for broader societal behaviors or expectations. By questioning the handling of antisemitic content while implicitly comparing it to other minorities' treatment, the tweet potentially contributes to a narrative that diminishes legitimate concerns about antisemitism, which is itself an aspect addressed in the IHRA examples.

Overall, the tweet can be seen as contributing to antisemitic attitudes by implying that Jewish concerns are overrepresented or overly prioritized, thus fitting within the broader context of perceptions and expressions of hatred towards Jews outlined in the IHRA definition.",No,"**

The tweet in question criticizes perceived inconsistencies in how antisemitic content is moderated on Twitter, suggesting that a user named Wiley would have been banned if his antisemitic remarks were directed at another minority group. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), this tweet does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic.

1. **Definition Analysis:** The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews specifically because they are Jewish. This includes actions against individuals, their property, religious facilities, and community institutions.

2. **Content of the Tweet:**
   - The tweet itself does not exhibit discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence towards Jews as Jews. Instead, it criticizes Twitter's response to antisemitic remarks.
   - It expresses frustration over what is perceived as a lack of action against antisemitism by comparing potential responses to similar actions directed at other minority groups.

3. **Guidelines Consideration:**
   - The tweet does not make generalizations about Jews or attribute negative traits inherently to them (Guideline A1).
   - It doesn’t use imagery, words, or ideas that link Jews with evil or conspiracy (Guideline A2).
   - There are no antisemitic stereotypes present in the wording of the tweet (Guidelines A3-A4).

4. **Contextual Understanding:**
   - The tweet is addressing an issue related to how antisemitism is handled compared to other forms of discrimination, which falls under social critique rather than antisemitism itself.
   - It seeks action against antisemitic behavior, not endorsing or expressing it.

In conclusion, the tweet criticizes a perceived inequity in handling antisemitic content on Twitter and does not itself express antisemitic sentiment according to the JDA's definition.",1,0,1,0,0,0
1256408042444390405,coopertrooper_,2020-05-02 02:19:54+00:00,0,Jews,antisemitism on “the left” is insanely rampant but it’s so commonly used as a smear that jews are put in this awesome position where we have to constantly say both “it’s not antisemitic to criticize israel” and also “don’t say ‘fuck anne frank’ please”,Yes,"According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, antisemitism can manifest in various forms, including rhetoric that employs stereotypes or negative character traits against Jews. The tweet you referenced contains elements that align with some aspects of this definition.

Firstly, the phrase ""antisemitism on 'the left' is insanely rampant"" could be interpreted as a stereotype about political groups harboring antisemitic views, which might contribute to divisive rhetoric without specific evidence or context, but it does not directly fall under antisemitic behavior itself according to IHRA's definition.

However, the tweet also includes ""jews are put in this awesome position where we have to constantly say both 'it’s not antisemitic to criticize israel' and also 'don’t say ‘fuck anne frank’ please'"". This part of the tweet raises concerns under several points in the IHRA definition:

1. **Criminal Acts**: The phrase ""don’t say ‘fuck Anne Frank’ please"" highlights a reference to Holocaust denial or trivialization, which is considered antisemitic under the IHRA framework as it involves denying or diminishing the severity of the Holocaust.

2. **Stereotyping and Characterization**: By framing Jews in the position where they must defend against accusations (""it’s not antisemitic to criticize Israel""), this tweet may unintentionally align with the stereotype that Jewish people are overly sensitive or defensive about criticism concerning Israel, which can be linked to broader patterns of delegitimizing Israeli statehood or actions.

3. **Emotive Language**: The use of emotionally charged words like ""insanely"" could amplify divisive perceptions and foster an environment where antisemitic sentiments are more easily spread or tolerated.

Therefore, while the tweet does not explicitly call for harm against Jews, it contains elements that can be interpreted as aligning with some manifestations of antisemitism according to the IHRA definition. This includes both a reference to Holocaust trivialization and potentially fostering stereotypes about Jewish reactions to criticism of Israel. Thus, based on these points, the tweet could indeed be considered antisemitic in its implications and rhetoric.",No,"**

The tweet you provided expresses the view that antisemitism is prevalent on ""the left"" and describes it as being used as a smear. It also mentions that Jews often find themselves in a position where they must balance between defending against accusations of antisemitism when criticizing Israel and opposing offensive statements like ""fuck Anne Frank."" 

According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), several key points are relevant here:

1. **Contextual Analysis**: The tweet does not directly engage with the specific guidelines of what constitutes antisemitism according to JDA. It discusses the perception that Jews need to navigate criticism of Israel and offensive rhetoric, without expressing antisemitic sentiments itself.

2. **Criticism vs. Hostility**: The content of the tweet critiques the use of accusations as smears but does not express hostility or prejudice against Jews as individuals or a group. It acknowledges a challenging situation for Jewish people, which implies concern rather than disdain.

3. **Holocaust Denial and Stereotypes**: There is no denial or minimization of the Holocaust, nor are there negative stereotypes about Jews (such as greed, disloyalty, etc.) present in this tweet.

4. **Coded Language**: While the tweet mentions criticism of Israel, it does not equate such criticism with antisemitism and acknowledges that ""it's not antisemitic to criticize Israel."" This aligns with guideline 13 of JDA, which states that evidence-based criticism of Israel is not inherently antisemitic.

5. **Intent and Interpretation**: The intent behind the tweet seems to be a commentary on societal dynamics rather than an expression of prejudice or hostility towards Jews. It reflects frustration with how accusations are used but does not itself propagate harmful stereotypes or conspiracy theories about Jewish people controlling entities like governments or media.

In conclusion, while the tweet discusses sensitive topics related to antisemitism and Israel, it does not meet the JDA's criteria for antisemitic speech as outlined in its definition and guidelines. It lacks elements of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. Therefore, based on this analysis, the tweet is not considered antisemitic according to the JDA.",1,0,1,0,0,0

The tweet in question could be interpreted as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it references a ""DV theory"" involving Jews, which likely refers to the discredited and harmful notion of ""Dual Visions."" This idea is often associated with conspiracy theories that attempt to divide Jewish people into conflicting groups or perspectives. The phrase suggests that genome research has proven something about the origins of Aryans, implying European origin and implicitly linking this narrative to broader historical antisemitic tropes concerning Jewish ancestry and influence.

Key aspects that align this tweet with the IHRA definition include:

1. **Mendacious Allegations**: By referencing theories like ""DV"" (Dual Visions), which have no basis in credible science or history, the tweet engages in spreading mendacious and stereotypical ideas about Jews, specifically regarding their historical origins and roles.

2. **Implications of Conspiracy**: The mention of genome research revealing European origin connects to broader antisemitic narratives that often involve conspiracy theories about Jewish control or influence over historical events and populations.

3. **Historical Stereotypes**: The tweet indirectly invokes a stereotype related to the ancient concept of ""Aryans,"" which has been misused historically in antisemitic propaganda, particularly during Nazi ideology, to construct false racial hierarchies and narratives.

The use of hashtags referencing European origins further suggests an underlying narrative that aligns with these harmful stereotypes. Although not overtly hateful or violent, the tweet perpetuates ideas rooted in historical antisemitism by suggesting a specific Jewish role in global history through unsupported theories. This could contribute to the broader perception of Jews in a negative light, consistent with IHRA's examples of antisemitic expressions.",No,"To determine if the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to assess it against the definition and guidelines provided.

1. **Definition of Antisemitism**: The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. It focuses on actions or expressions that target Jews specifically because they are Jewish.

2. **Content of the Tweet**: The tweet discusses genome research revealing a European origin for Aryans and mentions ""Jews & 'Jews of India'."" This reference seems to be about genetic studies and does not explicitly express prejudice, discrimination, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews.

3. **Guideline 1 (Essentializing)**: While the tweet discusses genetics and origins, it doesn't essentialize Jews in a way that attributes inherent negative character traits or makes sweeping generalizations based solely on Jewish identity. It refers to genetic findings rather than making statements about Jews as a group with derogatory intent.

4. **Guideline 2 (Linking Jews to Evil)**: The tweet does not link Jews to evil, conspiracy theories, or any hidden agenda that harms others. There is no mention of Jews possessing power or being involved in nefarious activities.

5. **Guidelines on Words and Deeds**: The language used in the tweet does not include antisemitic words (e.g., stereotypes about wealth, stinginess, or disloyalty) or deeds (such as attacks on Jewish individuals or institutions).

6. **Coded Speech**: There is no evidence of coded speech that would imply Jews have undue influence over global affairs or any other power dynamics that are typically associated with antisemitism.

7. **Holocaust Denial**: The tweet does not deny, minimize, or distort the history of the Holocaust.

8. **Israel and Palestine Context**: The tweet does not discuss Israel or Palestinian issues, so guidelines specific to these topics do not apply here.

In summary, while the tweet discusses genetic research related to Aryans and mentions ""Jews,"" it does not contain elements that fit the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

This scenario suggests a discriminatory act specifically targeting Jews based on their religious practice. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitic discrimination involves denying opportunities or services available to others due to their perceived association with Jewish identity or religion.

In this case, if the apprehension of Jews at synagogues is indeed motivated by bias against them as Jews and not applied equally to other groups wishing to attend places of worship, it constitutes antisemitic discrimination. The tweet implies that Jews are being unfairly targeted for enforcement action, which aligns with the IHRA definition's description of discrimination based on religious identity.

Additionally, targeting Jewish individuals or their institutions in such a manner can be seen as part of broader patterns of prejudice and bias, reflecting harmful stereotypes about Jewish people not adhering to societal norms or posing a threat. This reinforces negative perceptions and contributes to a hostile environment for the Jewish community, which is consistent with manifestations of antisemitism described by IHRA.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the tweet and its alignment with examples of antisemitic discrimination outlined by the IHRA definition, the situation can be considered an example of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question mentions that Jews arriving at synagogues for Sabbath services are being apprehended by law enforcement, despite an announcement by @realDonaldTrump suggesting that prayer is considered essential. To determine if this tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to assess it against the provided definition and guidelines.

1. **Discrimination or Hostility Against Jews as Jews**: The tweet itself does not express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews or Jewish institutions specifically because they are Jewish. It simply reports an occurrence where law enforcement is apprehending individuals at synagogues, which could be interpreted in various ways unrelated to antisemitism.

2. **Racism and Essentializing**: The tweet does not essentialize Jews or make sweeping negative generalizations about them. It describes a specific event without attributing any inherent characteristics or collective behavior to Jewish people as a group.

3. **Linkage to Evil Forces**: There is no suggestion in the tweet that links Jews with forces of evil, conspiracy theories, hidden power, control over governments, media, banks, or spreading disease. These are core elements identified by JDA as characteristic of antisemitism but are absent from this tweet.

4. **Manifestation in Words, Visuals, or Deeds**: The tweet does not use language that could be considered antisemitic according to the examples provided (e.g., stereotypes about wealth, stinginess, or unpatriotism). It neither employs visual imagery nor describes any deeds related to physical violence against Jews.

5. **Coded Antisemitism**: There is no indication of coded speech in the tweet that could be interpreted as antisemitic upon contextual examination. The tweet appears to address a specific situation without hidden meanings or implications about Jewish people collectively.

6. **Denial of Holocaust**: The content does not involve denial or minimization of the Holocaust, which is explicitly identified as antisemitic by JDA.

7. **Israel and Palestine Context**: Although some guidelines specifically address issues related to Israel and Palestine, this tweet focuses on a domestic incident in New Jersey involving law enforcement and synagogues, unrelated to Israeli politics or Jewish nationalism.

In conclusion, while the tweet reports an event that might raise concerns about potential discrimination or bias in its context (e.g., differential treatment of religious practices), it does not meet the criteria outlined by JDA for antisemitism. The content lacks elements such as prejudice against Jews specifically because they are Jewish, essentializing stereotypes, or coded language linking Jews to evil forces.

According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, manifestations of antisemitism include the use of dehumanizing stereotypes and negative character traits directed at Jewish people. 

In this case, using biblical scripture to imply that all Jews collectively exhibit disbelief or opposition towards Jesus can perpetuate a stereotype that aligns with historical antisemitic tropes, particularly those accusing Jews as a group of being antagonistic toward Christianity. This interpretation fits within the IHRA's example of ""mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews,"" even if unintentionally so.

Furthermore, it might also be seen as an accusation against Jewish people that echoes past antisemitic narratives where they were portrayed negatively in religious contexts. While the tweet does not explicitly call for harm or express hatred, its use of a specific biblical reference to ""the Jews"" can contribute to reinforcing harmful stereotypes about Jewish people being collectively resistant or hostile towards Christian beliefs. Thus, under the IHRA definition, such a message could be considered antisemitic due to its potential reinforcement of negative and generalized perceptions of Jewish identity.",No,"DECISION: No

EXPLICATION:

To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, we need to analyze its content in relation to the definition and specific guidelines provided by JDA.

1. **Definition Analysis**: The tweet contains a quote from John 8:22 of the Bible, where Jesus speaks about his followers' inability to follow him. This is presented as a biblical reference, not targeting Jews or Jewish institutions in any harmful manner. According to the JDA definition, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). The tweet does not exhibit these behaviors directly.

2. **Guideline Considerations**: 
   - **General Guidelines (1-5)**: The quote is not essentializing Jews, nor is it making sweeping negative generalizations about them. It doesn't link Jews to forces of evil or imply hidden power or control over governments, media, banks, etc. There are no words, images, or deeds in the tweet that manifest antisemitic sentiments.
   - **Israel and Palestine Guidelines (6-15)**: The quote is not applying classical antisemitic symbols, images, or stereotypes to Israel or Jews, nor does it hold Jews collectively responsible for any actions. It doesn't require Jews to condemn anything related to Israel or Zionism. There’s no assumption of loyalty or denial of Jewish rights in Israel.

3. **Contextual Analysis**: The tweet appears to be referencing a biblical passage without context indicating antisemitic intent or implication. JDA emphasizes that identifying coded speech is often a matter of context and judgment. In this case, the scriptural reference alone lacks context that would suggest an underlying antisemitic message.

In conclusion, based on the content of the tweet and the guidelines provided by JDA, there is no indication of antisemitism as per the definition or examples outlined. The tweet appears to be a neutral biblical quote without any direct or indirect harmful implications toward Jews. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic according to JDA standards.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Anyway what does economic status have to do with racism?,Yes,"The tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it involves a stereotypical allegation about Jews being wealthy, which is one of the common negative stereotypes associated with antisemitism. It implies that Jewish people collectively possess more wealth than is accurate or fair, perpetuating a harmful stereotype about Jewish economic power and influence. This type of characterization falls under ""making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such."" The tweet does not provide factual evidence for the claim and instead uses it to question why antisemitic stereotypes persist if they are false.

Furthermore, by questioning ""why do you think Jews are rich?"" in a dismissive manner, the response implies that these beliefs are prevalent but unfounded, which can indirectly validate such misconceptions. The use of this stereotype, even with an attempt to debunk it, reinforces negative perceptions about Jewish people as a collective group. This is consistent with the IHRA's examples where stereotypical allegations regarding Jews' control over economic sectors or resources contribute to antisemitism.

The tweet does not explicitly call for harm or discrimination against Jews, nor does it deny the Holocaust or claim that Israel is a racist endeavor. However, by perpetuating an inaccurate stereotype about Jewish wealth, it contributes to a broader pattern of thought that can underpin antisemitic attitudes and actions. Thus, according to the IHRA working definition, this tweet is considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question does not fall under the antisemitic categories outlined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). It specifically addresses a common stereotype about Jewish wealth and attempts to counter it with statistical information, suggesting that not all Jews are wealthy. This approach challenges the stereotype rather than reinforcing it.

1. **Essentialization**: The tweet acknowledges variability within the Jewish population regarding economic status, thereby countering the idea of essentializing Jews as inherently wealthy (Guideline 1).

2. **Negative Generalizations**: Rather than making a sweeping negative generalization about Jews being rich, the tweet provides information that challenges this notion by referencing data on income distribution among Jewish individuals in the U.S.

3. **Linkage to Evil or Conspiracies**: The tweet does not associate Jews with evil forces or conspiracy theories, nor does it imply any hidden agendas or control over societal institutions (Guideline 2).

4. **Manifestations of Antisemitism**: There is no use of antisemitic words, images, or deeds in the tweet. It neither employs derogatory language nor supports acts against Jewish people or their institutions.

5. **Directness and Coded Language**: The statement is direct and factual rather than coded, as it does not employ hidden meanings to convey antisemitism (Guideline 4).

6. **Holocaust Denial**: There is no mention of the Holocaust, denial of historical facts about Jewish persecution, or minimization of Nazi genocide (Guideline 5).

Overall, while the tweet addresses a stereotype related to Jewish economic status, it does so in a manner that seeks to debunk rather than promote this stereotype. Thus, according to the guidelines provided by the JDA, the tweet is not antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

1. **Historical Condemnation and Demonization**: The tweet references historical figures and movements like Mosley, who was associated with British fascism and anti-Semitic views. By mentioning this context alongside Jewish refugees fleeing Europe during World War II, the tweet evokes a connection between contemporary political opponents (""right-wing fuckers"") and past antisemitic activities. This can be interpreted as associating these individuals with historic acts of demonization against Jews.

2. **Stereotyping and Dehumanizing**: The language used in the tweet could be seen as dehumanizing or stereotypical. It accuses a group of people (implicitly those on the right-wing political spectrum) of hypocrisy, suggesting that their professed support for Jewish communities is insincere. This can reinforce negative stereotypes about individuals’ motivations within this group.

3. **Contextual Interpretation**: While the tweet does not explicitly use classic antisemitic symbols or direct hate speech, its implication in associating a contemporary political group with past anti-Semitic actions could contribute to an environment of hostility towards Jews, particularly when considering historical contexts and sensitivities regarding Jewish persecution.

4. **Charges against Groups**: The tweet indirectly charges individuals (by labeling them as right-wing) with historical antisemitic behavior, which aligns with the IHRA's example of ""accusing Jews...of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group.""

Given these points, while the tweet does not explicitly declare hatred towards Jews, its use of historical context and implications can contribute to an environment that reinforces antisemitic stereotypes and sentiments. Thus, according to the IHRA definition, it aligns with certain manifestations of antisemitism.",No,"** To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), it's important to analyze its content in light of the provided guidelines.

1. **Content Analysis**: The tweet criticizes right-wing individuals for hypocrisy, suggesting they would have supported historical figures or movements like Mosley and against Jewish refugees during World War II. It does not make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews as a group nor attributes inherent negative characteristics to them (Guideline A.1).

2. **Linkage of Jews with Evil**: The tweet doesn't imply that Jews are linked to forces of evil, which is central in classic antisemitism according to the JDA (Guideline A.2). It refers to historical political actions and stances rather than attributing negative qualities or powers to Jewish people as a whole.

3. **Manifestation Forms**: The tweet does not use words, images, or deeds that are inherently antisemitic in nature as described in Guideline A.3 (e.g., stereotypes about wealth, stinginess, or unpatriotism).

4. **Direct vs. Indirect Statements**: There is no coded language suggesting conspiracy theories, control by Jews over institutions, or racializing of Jewish people (Guidelines A.4 and 5). The tweet directly critiques political hypocrisy rather than making indirect antisemitic claims.

5. **Holocaust Denial or Minimization**: The tweet does not deny or minimize the Holocaust, which is a key aspect of antisemitism according to Guideline A.5.

6. **Israel-Palestine Context**: None of the specific examples regarding Israel and Palestine apply here as the tweet does not address actions by the state of Israel or collective responsibility (Guidelines B.6-10).

7. **Criticism Distinction**: According to Guidelines C.11-C.15, criticism that is political or focused on historical events—such as references to Mosley or World War II—is not in itself antisemitic. The tweet reflects a critique of right-wing political behavior and historical actions rather than targeting Jews collectively.

In conclusion, while the tweet may be contentious or provocative, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism outlined by the JDA. It targets specific behaviors and historical associations without attributing negative characteristics to Jewish people as a whole.",1,0,1,0,0,0

The only people posting about the France protest , that turned into an anti Semitic protest saying “dirty jews” are jews , no one else.",Yes,"The tweet implies that only Jewish individuals are concerned or vocal about incidents of antisemitism, which can be interpreted as a form of victim-blaming. This aligns with the IHRA definition's point on antisemitic rhetoric that often charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity and blames them for ""why things go wrong."" By suggesting that the response to antisemitic violence or protests is exclusively driven by Jewish individuals, it subtly reinforces a stereotype that Jews are overly sensitive or manipulative in drawing attention to their issues.

Furthermore, the tweet characterizes an anti-Semitic protest with phrases like “dirty jews,” indicating an endorsement of language and sentiment rooted in antisemitic stereotypes. This use of dehumanizing terminology (""dirty jews"") fits within the IHRA definition's examples of demonizing or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective.

Overall, while the tweet does not directly engage in traditional forms of antisemitic speech such as Holocaust denial or conspiracy theories, it perpetuates harmful narratives by framing Jewish responses to antisemitism as self-serving and insular, which can contribute to an environment where antisemitic acts are minimized or dismissed. This aligns with broader patterns identified by the IHRA definition that often blame Jews for their victimhood in such situations.",No,"** The tweet in question does not inherently exhibit antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition. Here's a breakdown of why this is the case:

1. **Content Analysis**: The tweet states that ""the only people I see speaking out about the Jewish man being stabbed are Jews,"" and similarly, it mentions that in response to an anti-Semitic protest, the participants were identified as saying “dirty jews.” These statements are observations made by the author of the tweet regarding who is responding or reacting to specific events.

2. **Guidelines Consideration**:
   - **General**: The JDA guidelines emphasize recognizing racism and antisemitism when they involve essentializing Jews or linking them to forces of evil. This tweet does not contain generalizations about Jews as a whole, nor does it attribute any inherent negative character traits to Jews.
   - **Specificity to Israel and Palestine**: Although these events seem related to antisemitic actions (like being stabbed because one is Jewish or protests turning anti-Semitic), the tweet itself does not address state-related issues nor does it generalize the actions of Israel or Jews in a way that could be deemed antisemitic.
   - **Contextual Understanding**: The observation that only Jews are speaking out against an attack on a Jew or addressing an anti-Semitic protest seems more focused on documenting reactions to specific incidents rather than expressing prejudice or hostility towards Jews.

3. **Coded Speech and Context**: There is no indication of coded language here; the tweet does not use metaphors, symbols, or stereotypes linked with historical antisemitism (as described in guidelines 2 and 4). Instead, it seems to be commenting on who is involved in particular discussions, without implying negative attributes about Jews as a group.

In summary, while the content of the tweet addresses sensitive topics related to antisemitic incidents, it does not itself manifest discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews.

Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Implication of Jewish Control or Aggression**: The statement implies that Jews are expanding territory forcefully, which can be seen as playing into stereotypes about Jewish behavior being aggressive or conspiratorial. This ties to the IHRA examples related to attributing negative character traits or sinister motives to Jews collectively.

2. **Criticism Framed as Antisemitism**: While criticism of a state's actions isn't inherently antisemitic, when such criticism is exclusively directed at Israel in ways that apply double standards compared to other countries, it can become problematic under the IHRA definition. The tweet suggests an underlying bias against Jewish people or their collective identity by singling out Jews in the context of territorial expansion.

3. **Historical and Political Sensitivity**: The language used—discussing stopping ""Jews from expanding""—echoes harmful historical narratives where Jewish communities were portrayed as threats to others, a theme that has been exploited in antisemitic propaganda throughout history.

Therefore, considering the overall context and potential implications of the tweet's message, it can be interpreted as containing elements of antisemitism according to the IHRA definition.",No,"** The tweet does not explicitly contain language or imagery that meets the criteria outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) for antisemitic content. Here's a breakdown of how the tweet aligns with or diverges from the JDA guidelines:

1. **General Discrimination, Prejudice, Hostility, or Violence:** The tweet does not express direct hostility towards Jews as individuals or Jewish institutions as such. It discusses actions related to territorial issues rather than targeting Jews collectively or individually based on their identity.

2. **Essentializing and Negative Generalizations:** The statement in the tweet does not essentialize Jews or make sweeping negative generalizations about them. Instead, it focuses on a specific issue—territorial expansion—which is framed as an action rather than an inherent trait of Jewish people.

3. **Linkage to Evil Forces:** There is no mention or implication that links Jews to evil forces or conspiracies. The tweet discusses a geopolitical issue (i.e., territorial expansion) without invoking anti-Jewish myths or fantasies.

4. **Manifestation in Words, Visuals, or Deeds:** The language used does not manifest antisemitic characteristics such as depicting Jews with negative stereotypes or calling for violence against Jewish people or institutions.

5. **Directness and Coded Language:** While the tweet addresses a contentious issue, it lacks coded language that would imply hidden antisemitic meanings (e.g., references to control or disproportionate influence).

6. **Israel-related Guidelines:** The tweet could potentially fall under guideline 6 regarding applying negative stereotypes to Israel, but without additional context suggesting such intent, this is not explicitly evident here.

7. **Criticism of Policies and Practices:** According to guideline 13, criticism of Israeli policies (e.g., territorial expansion) can be valid if evidence-based and focused on the state's actions rather than attributing them to Jewish people as a whole. The tweet discusses preventing territorial expansion but does not criticize Jews themselves or imply wrongdoing based solely on their identity.

In summary, while the tweet addresses a sensitive geopolitical issue, it does not fulfill the specific antisemitic criteria laid out in the JDA. Therefore, according to these guidelines, the tweet is not considered antisemitic. However, context and intent can be crucial, so further information might alter this assessment if it revealed additional nuances or implications.",1,0,1,0,0,0

The national socialists forced Jews to kneel in a gesture of submission and humiliation. Photo taken in Vienna, 1938. Those who do not know history are condemned to repeat it https://t.co/xWkVvFJ6to",Yes,"** According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, antisemitic acts include manifestations that target Jews through harmful rhetoric or actions based on stereotypes and negative characterizations. The tweet in question draws a parallel between current social gestures (like ""taking a knee"") and historical acts of submission forced upon Jews by National Socialists, using it as an argument against the former. Here’s why this can be considered antisemitic:

1. **Historical Misuse**: By invoking the memory of Jewish subjugation during Nazi rule, the tweet potentially leverages historical suffering in a way that is not contextually respectful or accurate. This misapplication could contribute to a narrative that exploits Jews’ tragic past for contemporary arguments.

2. **Demonization and Stereotyping**: The use of imagery associated with classic antisemitism (forced submission by Nazis) can perpetuate negative stereotypes about Jewish history, potentially dehumanizing or demonizing Jews by linking them symbolically to an act of subjugation.

3. **Collective Accusations**: The tweet implies a collective responsibility or victimization narrative by associating a current social movement with historical antisemitic persecution without sufficient context or nuance. This is reminiscent of the IHRA's noted example where Jews are held collectively responsible for unrelated actions or events.

4. **Intent and Perception**: While intent might be debated, perception plays a crucial role in defining antisemitism under the IHRA framework. The tweet can easily be perceived as using Jewish historical trauma to critique non-Jewish behavior, which aligns with using historical suffering of Jews for contemporary agendas—a potential misuse that fits within the broader definition provided by IHRA.

In summary, while the tweet may not explicitly mention Jews or Israel in a derogatory manner, its use of historically antisemitic imagery and comparisons can be interpreted as aligning with the characteristics outlined in the IHRA definition. Thus, it falls under what could be considered an antisemitic act due to its context and potential implications.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish. The tweet in question references historical events where Jews were forced by Nazis to kneel in a gesture of submission and humiliation during 1938 in Vienna. This is an accurate recounting of historical facts without making generalizations or attributions about Jews today.

The tweet draws a parallel between the past actions of the Nazis against Jews and contemporary movements like ""taking a knee,"" which is often associated with protest, not specifically targeting Jews or Jewish institutions. The comparison appears to be aimed at highlighting how certain actions can evoke memories of historical injustices rather than expressing prejudice against Jews as Jews.

While the tweet uses charged language (""historical precedent"") and makes a potentially contentious analogy, according to the JDA's guidelines, criticism that some may see as excessive or contentious is not inherently antisemitic. The key factor here is context: there's no indication within the tweet itself of essentializing Jews, attributing collective guilt, or applying antisemitic stereotypes or symbols specifically to contemporary Jewish communities.

Therefore, based on the JDA definition and guidelines provided, this tweet does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

It implies that there is a problematic element within the Jewish community itself, specifically targeting ""right-wing Jews."" This can contribute to dividing Jews into factions based on perceived ideological lines, which is reflective of a classic antisemitic trope — suggesting internal discord or division among Jews as inherently suspicious or troubling.

1. **Stereotyping and Division**: The tweet uses an implicit stereotype by suggesting that there are problematic behaviors specifically within ""right-wing Jews."" This aligns with the IHRA's mention of using sinister stereotypes about Jews, even if it does not outright demonize them.

2. **Implication of a Conspiracy or Internal Conflict**: By stating “wait until you hear what right wing jews say about other jews,” there is an insinuation that there may be harmful or negative sentiments being expressed internally within the Jewish community. This can foster the perception of Jews conspiring against each other, which feeds into antisemitic narratives of internal conflict or conspiracy.

3. **Dehumanizing and Demonizing**: Even if not explicitly stated, suggesting that one group of Jews is acting negatively towards another can dehumanize individuals by reducing their identities to harmful stereotypes associated with political orientation within the community. This aligns with the IHRA's point about making dehumanizing allegations against Jews as a collective.

The tweet does not explicitly call for violence or make direct accusations of harm, but it plays into negative characterizations and divisions that contribute to an antisemitic climate by promoting suspicion and discord among Jewish people based on ideological lines.

According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, drawing comparisons of contemporary actions (in this case, unrelated peaceful protest gestures) to those of the Nazis can be considered antisemitic when specifically related to Israel or Israelis. This particular tweet uses a historical event involving Jewish persecution to make an analogy with a current action that is not inherently related to any ethnic or religious group.

This comparison leverages Nazi-era antisemitism by equating a contemporary, non-violent gesture of protest (like taking a knee) with acts of oppression and dehumanization carried out against Jews during the Holocaust. Such comparisons can trivialize the historical suffering of Jews under Nazi rule and contribute to an environment where antisemitic attitudes are fostered. The tweet employs a sinister stereotype by implying that the act of ""taking a knee"" is similar in nature or intent to the forced submission of Jews, which aligns with the IHRA definition's description of using classic antisemitic symbols or imagery.

Therefore, under the IHRA working definition, this tweet can be considered an example of antisemitism because it uses historical persecution of Jews as a framework for criticizing contemporary actions without any direct relevance to Jewish people or Israel.",No,"**

The tweet in question draws a historical parallel between the act of ""taking a knee"" and the forced kneeling of Jews by National Socialists in 1938, emphasizing the importance of remembering history to avoid repeating past atrocities. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish.

1. **Historical Context and Intent**: The tweet uses a historical reference to caution against forgetting oppressive acts in history, which is not inherently directed at Jews today but rather aims to highlight a broader point about learning from the past. This context suggests it is more of an educational reminder than an expression of antisemitism.

2. **Absence of Direct Hostility or Prejudice**: The tweet does not exhibit direct hostility or prejudice towards contemporary Jewish individuals or communities. It does not use derogatory language, stereotypes, or imagery that targets Jews today.

3. **Comparison as Educational Tool**: Comparing current events to historical ones can be a powerful educational tool and is often used in discussions about human rights and social justice. In this case, the comparison aims to prevent the repetition of past injustices rather than delegitimize any group's actions or express hostility towards them.

4. **No Coded Language or Delegitimization**: The tweet does not contain coded language that suggests Jews control a nation or are inherently evil (guidelines 2 and 4). It also does not deny the existence of Jews or their right to exist, as outlined in guideline 10.

5. **Potential for Misinterpretation**: While some may interpret the comparison as offensive if they are unaware of its historical context, this potential misunderstanding does not automatically make it antisemitic under JDA's definition unless it crosses into prejudice or hostility against Jews specifically.

The tweet in question references stereotypes specifically related to ""Jews are greedy,"" which directly aligns with this point in the IHRA definition.

Although the tweet is framed within a context that suggests an analytical exercise (comparing different stereotypes), it nevertheless perpetuates harmful stereotypes by listing them alongside other derogatory racial and gender-based ones. This inclusion can be seen as dehumanizing or demonizing, even if unintentionally so, because it reaffirms these negative generalizations about Jews.

The tweet does not appear to provide a critical examination of why such stereotypes are harmful; instead, it implicitly suggests that the stereotypes could lead to similar logical conclusions, which risks normalizing them. This can contribute to an environment where antisemitic ideas are accepted or go unchallenged.

In summary, by mentioning and comparing negative Jewish stereotypes in a manner that could reaffirm those stereotypes without critical engagement, the tweet aligns with the IHRA's criteria for what constitutes antisemitism.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews specifically because they are Jewish, or against Jewish institutions as Jewish. The tweet in question does not target Jews or Jewish institutions with any form of direct prejudice, hostility, or negative stereotyping; rather, it discusses the problematic nature of stereotypes in general.

The user mentions various stereotypes, including ""Jews are greedy,"" to illustrate how applying such stereotypes can lead to harmful conclusions when generalized about any group. The tweet does not affirm these stereotypes but instead critiques them by showing their logical inconsistency and harmful effects if applied universally to other groups (e.g., ""black people steal"" or ""women are hoes""). 

The context of the tweet is a critique against stereotyping as a whole, making it clear that acknowledging such stereotypes exists for argumentative purposes rather than promoting them. The discussion aims at highlighting how these stereotypes can be misused and their potential to cause harm if accepted as truths.

Thus, while the mention of ""Jews are greedy"" might seem concerning on its own, within this context, the tweet is not advocating or promoting antisemitic sentiment but is instead critiquing stereotyping itself.

1. **Stereotyping and Demonizing**: By singling out Jews in this context without further explanation or broader historical context, the post may perpetuate negative stereotypes or demonize Jewish individuals by associating them with a specific punishment or action.

2. **Historical Context**: The tweet lacks context about the hadith's origin and purpose within Islamic jurisprudence. Without this information, it risks being interpreted as promoting hostility towards Jews in general, rather than discussing historical religious texts.

3. **Potential for Incitement**: Although not explicitly calling for harm against Jews today, sharing such a message can contribute to an environment of intolerance or hostility if perceived by some audiences as justifying negative actions or attitudes toward Jewish people.

4. **Targeting Based on Religion**: The tweet singles out individuals based on their religious identity (Jews), which aligns with the IHRA definition that includes targeting individuals because they are, or are perceived to be, Jewish.

Overall, the tweet can contribute to harmful perceptions and discrimination against Jews by focusing solely on a negative narrative involving their historical punishment without adequate context or balance. This is consistent with manifestations of antisemitism as outlined in the IHRA definition.",No,"DECISION: No

EXPLICATION:

The tweet in question reports an anecdote attributed to Jabir bin 'Abd Allah regarding a statement from the Prophet Muhammad about stoning two Jewish individuals for committing fornication. To determine if this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition, we need to analyze it against the provided guidelines.

1. **Definition of Antisemitism**: The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). This tweet does not express any form of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence towards Jews collectively. It merely reports a historical anecdote related to specific individuals.

2. **General Guidelines**:
   - The JDA emphasizes avoiding essentialization and negative generalizations about populations (Guideline 1), which this tweet does not engage in.
   - There is no indication of attributing Jews to forces of evil or conspiratorial power (Guideline 2).
   - The tweet lacks any verbal, visual, or physical antisemitic expression such as stereotypes or incitements against Jews (Guideline 3).

3. **Israel and Palestine Guidelines**:
   - The content does not pertain to Israel's conduct or the collective responsibility of Jews for Israeli policies (Guidelines 6-10), nor does it fall under guidelines about supporting Palestinian rights or criticizing Zionism, which are explicitly stated as non-antisemitic in the JDA (Guidelines 11-15).

The tweet appears to be a religious historical account rather than an expression of antisemitism. It neither targets Jewish people collectively nor expresses prejudice or hostility based on their identity as Jews. It's important to note that while this particular content is not classified as antisemitic according to the JDA, sensitivity and context are crucial when discussing religious texts and historical narratives involving any community.

While it does not explicitly use antisemitic stereotypes or language directly from the IHRA definition, its framing can be interpreted as potentially problematic for several reasons:

1. **Association with Jewish Identity**: The tweet focuses on a group specifically identified as involving Christians and Jews, thereby linking the hardships described to their religious identity.

2. **Implying Blame through Association**: By drawing an implicit parallel between the situation in Russia (""Putin doesn't pay them their pensions *(sound familiar anyone?)*"") and potentially Israel or Jewish communities elsewhere, it suggests a shared victimhood that could be perceived as exploiting historical antisemitic themes of Jews suffering under oppressive regimes. The use of ""sound familiar"" can evoke associations with broader narratives where Jews are seen as perpetual victims.

3. **Vague Accusations**: Although the tweet does not directly accuse Jewish people or institutions, it uses a context that some might interpret as aligning with antisemitic rhetoric by indirectly invoking a scenario where Jews are portrayed as suffering due to geopolitical maneuvers. The mention of ""starving"" them can resonate with stereotypes about victimization and persecution.

4. **Lack of Contextual Nuance**: Without additional context, the tweet risks being perceived as an example of using Jewish identity or associations with Jews (in this case, through their organization) to make a broader political point, which can align with patterns where Jewish communities are scapegoated or used symbolically in geopolitical criticisms.

Therefore, while not explicitly antisemitic by any single line from the IHRA definition, the tweet's implications and context could reasonably be interpreted as fitting within an antisemitic framework under certain interpretations. The overall tone and potential for misinterpretation contribute to this assessment.",No,"The tweet in question describes the conditions faced by members of the International Fellowship of Christians & Jews living in Russia, mentioning issues such as lack of pensions, firewood, and running water. This description does not inherently contain antisemitic elements according to the JDA definition.

1. **Discrimination, Prejudice, Hostility or Violence**: The tweet does not explicitly discriminate against, express prejudice towards, show hostility against, or incite violence towards Jews as Jews. It focuses on describing difficult living conditions without attributing blame to Jewish identity itself.

2. **Sweeping Generalizations or Essentializing**: There are no sweeping negative generalizations made about Jews or attempts to essentialize Jewish characteristics in the tweet.

3. **Linkage of Jews with Evil Forces**: The content does not imply any linkage between Jews and evil forces, nor does it suggest a conspiracy or hidden power associated with Jewish people.

4. **Manifestation in Words, Images, Deeds**: There are no antisemitic words, images, or deeds present in the tweet. It lacks derogatory language or imagery traditionally used to demean Jews.

5. **Direct or Indirect Coded Messages**: The tweet does not contain coded messages that would suggest Jews possess hidden power or control over other entities (e.g., governments, media). It discusses a specific situation without broader implications about Jewish influence.

6. **Holocaust Denial**: There is no denial or minimization of the Holocaust present in the content of the tweet.

In conclusion, while the tweet describes a challenging situation faced by Jews in Russia and mentions Putin's government, it does not meet the criteria for antisemitism as outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism.

Saying ""Comparing the situation in the USA to Nazi Germany is wrong bc nobody's slaughtering Jews yet"" ignores the entire build up to the genocide as well as the genocidal attempts already going on here.",Yes,"** The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition because it draws a comparison between contemporary situations and Nazi Germany, specifically by referencing Jews. This falls under one of the examples provided by the IHRA that describes drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis as potentially antisemitic.

The tweet states: ""Comparing the situation in the USA to Nazi Germany is wrong bc nobody's slaughtering Jews yet,"" which implicitly uses Jewish suffering during the Holocaust as a benchmark for genocide. This type of rhetoric can trivialize or minimize historical events like the Holocaust by suggesting that only actions resulting in mass murder qualify as genocidal, ignoring other forms of oppression and systemic violence.

Moreover, this comparison may evoke antisemitic stereotypes about Jews being associated with conspiracy theories or exaggerated threats. The tweet implies that unless an action mirrors the most extreme form of Jewish persecution (i.e., ""slaughtering Jews""), it is not comparable to Nazi Germany. This reflects a misunderstanding of both history and contemporary issues while indirectly perpetuating harmful narratives.

Additionally, by stating that genocidal attempts are already occurring ""here,"" without providing context or evidence, the tweet could contribute to fearmongering or unfounded claims about Jewish people or Israel, which can be perceived as antisemitic under IHRA guidelines. The statement may be interpreted as part of a broader pattern of rhetoric that assigns collective blame or portrays Jews in a negative light by drawing historical parallels without due sensitivity.

In summary, while the tweet does not explicitly contain overtly antisemitic language, it engages with themes and comparisons recognized by the IHRA as potentially antisemitic. It uses Jewish history in a way that can be seen as minimizing past atrocities and fostering harmful stereotypes, aligning with elements of the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet in question states that comparing the situation in the USA to Nazi Germany is wrong because, at present, there isn't an active genocide against Jews.

1. **Discrimination, Prejudice, Hostility, or Violence Against Jews**: The tweet does not express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews or Jewish institutions based solely on their identity as Jews. It is critiquing the appropriateness of a historical analogy rather than making an antisemitic assertion.

2. **Essentializing or Negative Generalizations about Jews**: The tweet does not make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews or attribute inherent characteristics to them as a group. Instead, it focuses on the specific context of genocide and its presence (or absence) in current events.

3. **Linkage of Jews with Evil or Conspiracy**: There is no mention or implication of Jews being linked to evil forces or any conspiracy theories involving Jews controlling governments, media, etc., which are central themes in classical antisemitism as described by the JDA.

4. **Denial or Minimization of the Holocaust**: The tweet does not deny or minimize the Holocaust; rather, it acknowledges past genocides and suggests caution about using such analogies without considering current contexts. It reflects a concern about the accuracy and sensitivity of historical comparisons.

5. **Contextual Relevance to Israel/Palestine Debate**: The JDA provides specific guidelines for when criticisms related to Israel might be antisemitic, but this tweet does not involve or reference the State of Israel, Zionism, Jewish people's collective responsibility for Israel's actions, etc.

The key issue addressed in the tweet is about historical comparison and its appropriateness rather than an attack on Jews as a group. While the discussion may touch on sensitive topics related to genocide, it does not align with antisemitic criteria according to the JDA guidelines. The argument focuses more on political discourse and historical sensitivity rather than exhibiting prejudice against Jewish people specifically.",1,0,1,0,0,0

1. **Historical Inaccuracy**: The claim about Jordan ethnically cleansing eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank of Jews between 1948 and 1967 is misleading. During this period, many Jewish residents were forced to leave their homes due to hostilities, but describing it as ""ethnic cleansing"" in the context used here can be seen as an attempt to delegitimize or negatively portray Jordanian control by equating it with actions typically associated with extreme forms of violence and ethnic persecution.

2. **Delegitimization**: The tweet implies that only under Israeli rule are holy sites accessible to all faiths, which could contribute to a narrative that questions the legitimacy of any non-Israeli governance in these territories. This can be seen as part of applying double standards by not recognizing similar situations with other nations or historical contexts.

3. **Perpetuating Stereotypes**: By focusing on a narrative where only Israeli rule ensures access to holy sites, it indirectly supports a perception that Jews require their own state for protection and rights, which aligns with stereotypes about Jewish dependency on the State of Israel for safety and recognition.

4. **Overall Context**: While criticism of historical events or policies is not inherently antisemitic, when presented in ways that perpetuate negative stereotypes or delegitimize Israel as a Jewish state without similar scrutiny applied to other countries, it can cross into antisemitic territory according to the IHRA definition.

Therefore, considering these points, the tweet aligns with several aspects of the IHRA working definition of antisemitism.",No,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews, or Jewish institutions as Jewish. The tweet in question does not directly target Jews as a group based on their identity nor does it portray them with classic antisemitic stereotypes such as linking Jews to evil forces.

The content of the tweet focuses on historical and current political events related to territorial control over Jerusalem and the West Bank. It compares the period when Jordan controlled eastern Jerusalem and the West Bank (1948-1967) with the present situation under Israeli rule, suggesting changes in access to holy sites for various faiths. This is a discussion of geopolitical history rather than an expression of antisemitism.

The tweet does not employ language or imagery that fits into the antisemitic categories outlined by the JDA, such as generalizing about Jews, linking them with evil forces, holding them collectively responsible for actions taken by the state of Israel, or denying their right to exist and flourish. Instead, it makes a historical comparison and comments on access rights under different administrations.

Moreover, according to the guidelines provided in section C of the JDA regarding discussions about Israel and Palestine, criticism or commentary that reflects political opinions or interpretations of historical events does not inherently constitute antisemitism. The tweet can be seen as part of a discussion on Israeli policies and history without crossing into antisemitic territory, aligning with guideline 13 which permits evidence-based criticism of the state of Israel.

The sheer numbers, we’re being overwhelmed 2. Their dreadful religion",Yes,"** The tweet in question is antisemitic according to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism for several reasons:

1. **Demonizing and Stereotyping:** The phrase ""Their dreadful religion"" can be interpreted as a demonizing stereotype targeting Muslims specifically, but it also indirectly contributes to an atmosphere that fosters discrimination based on religious and ethnic backgrounds more broadly, including against Jews.

2. **Historical Sensitivity and Comparison:** While the tweet does not directly target Jews with negative stereotypes or accusations, it mentions ""the Jews"" alongside other groups in a positive light (""all added to the industry and vibrancy of our country and culture""), yet juxtaposes this positive note with current challenges attributed specifically to immigration issues. This context can be seen as aligning with antisemitic narratives that historically have portrayed Jewish people as outsiders or contributors to societal problems.

3. **Collective Blame:** The tweet implies a collective problem (""the sheer numbers, we’re being overwhelmed"") linked to immigrants and refugees, which can be interpreted through an antisemitic lens when considering the broader narrative of blaming specific groups for societal issues.

4. **Underlying Tone:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the IHRA examples, the underlying tone of the tweet reflects a kind of exclusionary or nativist sentiment that can intersect with antisemitic attitudes. The historical pattern of attributing economic and social problems to Jewish communities is relevant here; even if Jews are listed as a positive example, the overall message contributes to an environment where discrimination based on group identity is normalized.

Overall, while the tweet does not explicitly mention Jews in a negative context or directly perpetuate classic antisemitic tropes about Jewish people controlling societal institutions or being responsible for various ills, its framing and implications can contribute to an atmosphere that is hostile towards Jews as part of broader discriminatory narratives. Therefore, it aligns with the IHRA definition when considering the contemporary manifestations of antisemitism in public life and media.",No,"The tweet mentions Jews positively, noting their contributions to the country's industry and culture alongside other groups like the Huguenots, Irish, and West Indians. This positive acknowledgment does not align with antisemitic behavior as defined by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), which includes making sweeping negative generalizations or linking Jews inherently with evil.

However, it is important to address two aspects of the tweet:
1. **Negative Generalization about Immigration**: The tweet states that ""the sheer numbers"" and ""their dreadful religion"" are problems. This part could be interpreted as a broad negative statement regarding immigrants' religions, including Judaism. While this may reflect xenophobic or Islamophobic sentiments depending on the context (especially considering current global political climates), it does not specifically target Jews with hostility based solely on their Jewish identity.
   
2. **Context of ""Dreadful Religion""**: The phrase ""dreadful religion"" is vague and could be interpreted as directed towards any religious group, including Islam or Christianity, depending on the context in which the tweet was made. Without explicit targeting of Judaism or Jews, this statement does not fit neatly into the antisemitic guidelines outlined by JDA.

In conclusion, while the tweet contains potentially offensive language regarding religion and immigration numbers that could be seen as problematic or insensitive, it does not specifically manifest antisemitism according to the definition provided by the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism.",1,0,1,0,0,0

It was about creating a cover story as the establishment protected itself from democratic socialism https://t.co/M1U7MXtxhz",Yes,"** The tweet in question suggests that the concern over antisemitism, particularly within political contexts such as under the leadership of Keir Starmer, was not genuinely about protecting Jewish people but rather served as a pretext to shield establishment interests from democratic socialism. This assertion aligns with several key elements outlined in the IHRA definition of antisemitism:

1. **Accusation of Conspiracy**: The tweet implies that discussions and actions related to antisemitism are part of a broader conspiracy by the establishment against democracy or socialist movements, rather than genuine concerns about antisemitic behavior. This mirrors the stereotype mentioned in the IHRA definition where Jews are accused of conspiring to harm humanity.

2. **Instrumentalization**: By suggesting that the ""antisemitism furor"" was used as a cover story, it implies that claims of antisemitism can be manipulated for ulterior motives. While skepticism about motivations behind political actions is not inherently antisemitic, framing such concerns exclusively in terms of conspiracies against democratic socialism may inadvertently reinforce harmful stereotypes.

3. **Discrediting Genuine Concerns**: The tweet could undermine legitimate efforts to address and combat antisemitism by suggesting that these efforts are insincere or politically motivated rather than rooted in genuine concern for the Jewish community's welfare.

Overall, while not every critical discussion of political actions or motives is antisemitic, this particular framing has elements that could be seen as aligning with patterns of thought identified by the IHRA as antisemitic. Therefore, under the IHRA definition, this tweet can reasonably be interpreted as having antisemitic undertones.",No,"The tweet in question suggests that the antisemitism furor was not genuinely about protecting Jews but rather served as a pretext for the establishment to protect itself from democratic socialism. To evaluate whether this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to consider the specific criteria outlined in its definition and guidelines.

1. **Discrimination, Prejudice, Hostility, or Violence**: The tweet does not express direct discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish. It discusses a broader political narrative rather than targeting Jews personally or their religious and cultural identity.

2. **Essentialization or Negative Generalizations**: The tweet does not essentialize Jews or make sweeping negative generalizations about them as a group. Instead, it critiques the use of antisemitism accusations within a specific political context.

3. **Linkage to Evil Forces**: There is no suggestion that Jews are linked to evil forces or conspiracy theories involving Jewish power and control over governments or institutions.

4. **Manifestations in Words, Images, or Deeds**: The tweet does not contain antisemitic words, images, or deeds as defined by the JDA guidelines. It does not use derogatory language about Jews or depict them negatively.

5. **Holocaust Denial**: There is no denial or minimization of the Holocaust in this tweet.

6. **Israel and Palestine Context**: The tweet does not relate to Israel or Palestinians directly but discusses a domestic political situation involving allegations of antisemitism within a different context (the UK Labour Party under Keir Starmer). It neither applies negative stereotypes about Israel nor holds Jews collectively responsible for any state conduct.

7. **Criticism of Political Actions**: According to guidelines 13 and 14, it is not inherently antisemitic to criticize political actions or policies if done evidence-based without relying on harmful stereotypes or conspiracy theories. The tweet appears to critique the motivations behind certain political narratives rather than targeting Jewish individuals or groups.

In conclusion, while the tweet presents a critical view of how allegations of antisemitism have been used within a specific political context, it does not meet the criteria for being classified as antisemitic under the JDA definition. It lacks elements such as essentializing Jews, linking them to evil forces, or using Holocaust denial. Instead, it addresses a perceived misuse of antisemitism accusations in political discourse, which is distinct from expressing antisemitism itself.",1,0,1,0,0,0

This example highlights mendacious, dehumanizing, and stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective group, specifically focusing on the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or Jews controlling various societal institutions. By acknowledging this theory as deeply antisemitic, the tweet recognizes it as part of harmful stereotypes that contribute to hatred towards Jews. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, mentioning and identifying such conspiracy theories as antisemitic falls within the understanding of expressing or recognizing antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question states that ""The theory as well as its founder are deeply cemented in antisemitic 'Jews rule the world' conspiracy theories."" According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, it is specifically antisemitic to propagate or support conspiracy theories that suggest Jews possess hidden power and use it for their own collective agenda at the expense of others. However, the tweet does not itself promote such a theory; rather, it identifies another statement or theory as being deeply connected with such an antisemitic belief.

The individual tweeting is attempting to contextualize what they perceive as an ""antisemitic"" position held by someone else (referred to as ""@Opaliez""). The tweet acknowledges the presence of antisemitic elements in the other's argument, rather than advancing them. By highlighting that a theory or its founder are tied to antisemitic conspiracy theories, the tweeter is critiquing and clarifying these points, not endorsing or propagating them.

Furthermore, the tweet explicitly states a lack of agreement with what ""they"" (presumably @Opaliez) were saying, suggesting an intent to explain rather than agree. This indicates that the purpose of the tweet is to critique or discuss the antisemitic nature of another's views, not to support those views themselves.

Specifically, it references the requirement for a quorum (minyan) of ten Jews present for certain religious activities, using this as fodder for humor by suggesting its only purpose is to serve as a ""plot device"" in media. This trivializes an important aspect of Jewish communal life and can contribute to reinforcing negative stereotypes.

While the tweet may not fit neatly into any one category outlined in the IHRA examples—such as denying the Holocaust or making dehumanizing allegations—it does align with the broader definition of antisemitism by promoting a certain perception of Jews. This perception, expressed through humor that targets Jewish religious practices, can perpetuate a misunderstanding and trivialization of Jewish customs, contributing to a wider societal narrative that marginalizes or stereotypes Jewish people.

Moreover, although this tweet does not directly incite violence or discrimination against Jews, it employs ""sinister stereotypes"" by reducing complex religious practices to mere plot devices. This aligns with the IHRA's acknowledgment that antisemitism is expressed in various forms, including speech and writing, which can include jokes or humorous content that perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

Therefore, while not overtly aggressive, the tweet contributes to a narrative that could foster misunderstanding or bias against Jewish people by trivializing their religious practices for comedic effect. This fits within the IHRA's broader understanding of antisemitism as encompassing both direct and indirect manifestations.",No,"** The tweet in question uses humor to reference the Jewish tradition of needing ten Jews (a minyan) present for certain religious activities. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions.

1. **Essentialization and Generalizations**: The tweet does not essentialize Jewish traits in a negative or harmful way; instead, it humorously references a well-known aspect of Jewish religious practice. There is no sweeping negative generalization about the Jewish population.

2. **Linkage to Evil or Conspiracies**: The tweet does not link Jews to evil forces or suggest any form of conspiracy involving hidden power or influence over others, which are critical aspects identified by JDA in antisemitic rhetoric.

3. **Manifestation through Words/Deeds**: While the tweet is a verbal expression (word), it lacks hostility or prejudice against Jews. It does not depict Jews negatively nor advocate for any action against them or their institutions.

4. **Direct vs. Indirect/Coded Language**: The content of the joke is straightforward and pertains to a cultural practice without hidden meanings that might be interpreted as coded antisemitism. There's no context suggesting indirect hostility towards Jewish people.

5. **Holocaust Denial/Minimization**: This tweet does not engage with or negate historical facts about the Holocaust, so it does not fall under this specific category of antisemitism outlined by JDA.

While this is a scriptural reference and might be interpreted in various ways depending on context, it can potentially be seen as contributing to antisemitic sentiment under the IHRA definition when considered alongside specific aspects:

1. **Implying Superiority or Exclusivity:** The verse could be interpreted as suggesting that only Jewish people are connected with true worship and salvation. This might imply a form of superiority or exclusivity, which can contribute to stereotypes about Jews holding some unique power or status regarding religious truth.

2. **Potential for Dehumanization or Demonization:** Although the tweet itself does not explicitly dehumanize or demonize Jews, the implication that non-Jews ""worship ye know not what"" might be used by others as a basis for dehumanizing those who do not adhere to Jewish beliefs, thus feeding into antisemitic narratives.

3. **Context of Use:** If the tweet is part of broader discourse that uses religious references to justify negative views or actions toward Jews, it can contribute to an environment where antisemitic ideas are normalized.

4. **Symbolism and Imagery:** By highlighting a scriptural verse that distinguishes between Jewish and non-Jewish worship in this manner, there may be an implicit reinforcement of classic antisemitic imagery or themes that separate Jews as fundamentally different or superior in spiritual matters.

Given these points, if the tweet is used or interpreted in contexts that promote negative stereotypes about Jews or contribute to their exclusion or discrimination, it aligns with aspects of the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Therefore, while scripture alone might not be inherently antisemitic, its use can potentially serve as such when contributing to broader harmful narratives against Jewish people.",No,"** According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet in question contains a biblical verse from the King James Version of the Bible: ""Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews."" This statement refers to an excerpt from the Gospel of John (John 4:22) and appears within its religious context, as indicated by the hashtag #TheBiblicalLogic.

1. **Contextual Nature:** The JDA emphasizes that antisemitism can be direct or indirect, explicit or coded, but often depends on context. Here, the content is a biblical quotation without additional commentary that might suggest hostility or prejudice against Jews in contemporary terms.

2. **Religious Interpretation:** The verse reflects a religious perspective common in Christian theological discourse rather than an assertion of modern antisemitic stereotypes or claims about Jewish people as a group today. It discusses spiritual belief and salvation, concepts intrinsic to Christian theology rather than implying any form of inherent negativity towards Jews.

3. **Absence of Negative Stereotypes:** The tweet does not apply the negative symbols, images, or stereotypes associated with classical antisemitism (as outlined in JDA guidelines 2 and 3) to Jews today. There is no depiction of Jews as inherently evil, controlling entities, or other historically prejudiced characterizations.

4. **Lack of Hostility or Prejudice:** The tweet does not express hostility, prejudice, discrimination, or call for violence against Jewish people or institutions. It neither holds Jews collectively responsible for negative acts nor implies any contemporary conspiratorial power attributed to them.

5. **Protected Speech and Religious Expression:** As per JDA guideline 15, political speech—and by extension, religious expression—is protected under human rights conventions. The content of the tweet falls within this protection as a theological statement rather than an antisemitic commentary.

Additionally, by suggesting that they should simply ""adapt to the 21st century,"" the tweet dismisses legitimate concerns regarding discrimination and censorship, which can be seen as a form of trivializing or undermining their experiences. This could be interpreted as aligning with antisemitic narratives that blame Jews for broader societal problems by attributing any criticism towards them to irrational complaints.

1. **Discrimination, Prejudice, Hostility, or Violence**: The tweet does not contain direct expressions of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews or Jewish institutions. It mentions ""crackers"" complaining about censorship but does not attribute any negative character traits to Jews themselves, nor does it suggest hostility towards them.

2. **Essentializing or Negative Generalizations (Guideline A1)**: The tweet does not essentialize Jews by attributing inherent characteristics or making sweeping generalizations about the Jewish population. It discusses censorship complaints more generally without targeting Jews specifically in a negative way.

3. **Linking Jews to Evil (Guideline A2)**: There is no indication that Jews are linked to evil or portrayed as having hidden power or conspiratorial influence, which is a core feature of antisemitism according to the JDA.

4. **Manifestation in Words, Images, and Deeds (Guideline A3)**: The language used does not include classic antisemitic words, images, or deeds such as stereotypes about wealth, stinginess, or unpatriotism specifically directed at Jews.

5. **Direct or Indirect, Explicit or Coded Speech (Guideline A4)**: There is no explicit or coded antisemitic speech present in the tweet. It does not contain statements like ""the Rothschilds control the world"" that would imply Jewish conspiracy theories.

6. **Denial of Holocaust (Guideline A5)**: The tweet does not deny, minimize, or distort historical facts about the Holocaust.

Here are key points to consider:

1. **Conspiracy Theory**: The statement implies a deceptive or ulterior motive behind the establishment of Israel, suggesting an intention to alter Jewish religious identity rather than providing safety from antisemitism. This can echo the antisemitic stereotype that Jews cannot be trusted and have hidden agendas.

2. **Distortion of Historical Facts**: By claiming that Israel's creation was not for a ""safe haven"" or to combat antisemitism, the tweet misrepresents historical realities. The state of Israel was indeed established as a response to centuries of persecution against Jews, providing them with a sovereign homeland where they could seek refuge from antisemitic violence.

3. **Collective Responsibility and Identity**: The statement that ""they aimed to create a new type of Jew whose identity is based on land & culture"" can imply collective responsibility for an alleged betrayal or manipulation of Jewish identity by Zionists, which resonates with the idea of accusing Jews of disloyalty or internal conflict.

4. **Negative Stereotypes and Conspiracies**: By suggesting that Zionism involves replacing Judaism with a nationalist ideology, it indirectly supports stereotypes about Jewish power dynamics and control over their own community's cultural or religious identity. This can feed into broader antisemitic narratives of manipulation and conspiracy among Jews.

5. **Overall Context**: The overall context of the statement is negative towards Israel and its foundational principles, which are often unfairly conflated with Judaism in contemporary discourse. While criticism of Israeli policies can be legitimate, this tweet crosses into antisemitism by insinuating nefarious intentions behind Jewish self-determination efforts.

The combination of these factors makes the tweet align with several examples provided in the IHRA definition of antisemitism, particularly those involving conspiracy theories, distortion of history, and negative stereotypes about Jewish identity and agency.",No,"**

The tweet in question states that ""Israel was created to remove Judaism from Jews and replace it with a nationalist Zionism,"" suggesting motivations for the establishment of Israel. To determine if this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze whether it fits within the provided definition or guidelines.

1. **Definition Analysis**: The tweet does not explicitly express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). Instead, it presents a perspective on the ideological motivations behind Zionism and the founding of Israel.

2. **Guideline 4 - Coded Language**: Guideline 4 addresses coded language, implying that some statements may indirectly express antisemitic sentiments by disguising them with context-dependent phrasing. However, the tweet does not employ coded language that links Jews to evil or portrays them in a historically negative stereotype (e.g., conspiracy theories about Jewish control over global affairs).

3. **Guidelines 6-10**: These guidelines focus on applying classical antisemitic stereotypes to Israel or holding all Jews collectively responsible for its actions. The tweet does not attribute the conduct of the State of Israel directly to Jews as a group or apply negative stereotypes typical in classic antisemitism.

4. **Guideline 12-15 (Non-Antisemitic Contexts)**: These guidelines recognize that criticism of Israel, including its founding principles and political ideology like Zionism, does not inherently constitute antisemitism if it is evidence-based and non-hostile toward Jews. The tweet criticizes the ideological foundation of Zionism without attributing blame or expressing hostility to Jewish people as a collective.

5. **Historical Context**: Historically, discussions around Zionism have varied widely in interpretation. While some view its emergence with skepticism regarding nationalism overshadowing traditional Jewish religious identity, such views are part of legitimate political discourse rather than antisemitic rhetoric per se.

In conclusion, while the tweet offers a critical perspective on the purpose behind Israel's creation and critiques the Zionist movement, it does not exhibit elements that fit within the JDA definition of antisemitism.

It was about creating a cover story as the establishment protected itself from democratic socialism https://t.co/M1U7MXtxhz",Yes,"** 

The tweet suggests that the ""antisemitism furor"" was not genuinely concerned with protecting Jews but rather served to shield the establishment from democratic socialism. This implies a motive behind addressing or highlighting antisemitic concerns, suggesting they are used as tools for political maneuvering rather than being genuine issues needing attention.

Here’s how this connects to the IHRA definition of antisemitism:

1. **Conspiracy Theory:** The statement aligns with one of the core examples in the IHRA definition that accuses Jews or Jewish organizations (in this case, implied through associations like Keir Starmer's leadership and his focus on addressing antisemitism within the Labour Party) of being part of a larger conspiracy. It suggests an ulterior motive where antisemitic allegations are used as a ""cover story"" for political ends.

2. **Delegitimization:** By asserting that the issue was never about safeguarding Jews, it implies that concerns over antisemitism were exaggerated or fabricated for other purposes. This can be seen as questioning the legitimacy of Jewish individuals and groups raising genuine concerns about discrimination or violence against them.

3. **Instrumentalization:** The tweet suggests instrumentalizing antisemitism accusations, indicating they are used to serve another agenda (protecting from democratic socialism), rather than addressing real issues faced by Jewish communities. This fits within antisemitic frameworks where Jews are seen as manipulative or conspiratorial actors in broader political contexts.

The overall context of the tweet does not explicitly deny historical facts like the Holocaust but instead uses the perception and handling of antisemitism for a potentially misleading narrative, consistent with certain manifestations of antisemitism outlined by the IHRA. Thus, based on the IHRA working definition, this tweet can be considered antisemitic.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is defined as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews because they are Jewish or against Jewish institutions as Jewish. The tweet in question states that ""the antisemitism furor was never about safeguarding Jews,"" suggesting a skepticism towards motivations behind addressing antisemitism rather than expressing direct prejudice, hostility, or discrimination against Jews themselves.

The tweet implies a political motive behind actions purportedly aimed at protecting Jews, specifically relating to the political figure Keir Starmer. This falls more into a critique of perceived hypocrisy or misuse of the issue of antisemitism in political contexts, which does not inherently target Jews as Jews nor Jewish institutions in their identity as Jewish.

Furthermore, according to the JDA guidelines:

- Point 2 highlights classic antisemitic ideas involving conspiracy and hidden power attributed to Jews. The tweet does not suggest any such conspiracies.
- Points related to Israel and Palestine (guidelines B6-10) focus on stereotyping or demonizing the State of Israel in a manner similar to historical antisemitism; the tweet does not make statements about Israel that would fit these descriptions.

The tweet is more an expression of political opinion, critiquing what it perceives as the instrumentalization of antisemitism accusations for other purposes. While such critiques can be contentious or controversial, they do not inherently cross into antisemitism unless they involve spreading stereotypes or prejudices against Jews specifically because they are Jewish.

In conclusion, while the tweet may express a critical perspective on political handling of antisemitism issues, it does not meet the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

The tweet in question attempts to draw a direct parallel between current events and the Holocaust without providing evidence for such claims, which could fall under the category of employing sinister stereotypes.

1. **Dehumanization and Demonization**: By stating ""Hitler did exactly the same with Jews,"" the tweet employs historical atrocities as an unfounded basis for comparison, potentially implying that the actions or situations described in the linked content are equivalent to the Holocaust without justification. This could be seen as a form of dehumanizing or demonizing rhetoric.

2. **Historical Manipulation**: The reference to how Hitler ""used the excuse of plague"" and the subsequent progression to ghettos, concentration camps, and gas chambers uses historical trauma in an inappropriate context, which may evoke antisemitic tropes about Jewish conspiracy or vulnerability without substantiation.

3. **Contextual Consideration**: While criticism of policies or actions can be legitimate if comparable to those directed at other nations or groups, invoking the Holocaust as a rhetorical device without clear, factual justification risks trivializing it and falls into manipulative comparisons that can fuel antisemitic sentiment.

4. **Implications for Current Events**: By linking present-day events directly with Nazi tactics in such a manner, the tweet could incite hatred or fear toward Jewish people or Israelis by drawing on historical stereotypes and fears without sufficient basis.

2. **Comparative Analysis:** It compares current actions with historical events to highlight perceived similarities. Such comparisons are not inherently antisemitic; they may be contentious but do not necessarily target Jews or Jewish institutions in a prejudiced manner.

3. **Critique of Current Events:** The tweet appears to criticize what it views as ""ethnic cleansing,"" without attributing these acts directly to any Jewish individuals, organizations, or Israel. This aligns with guideline 13, which allows for evidence-based criticism of states' actions without inherently being antisemitic.

4. **Intent and Content:** The content does not include the stereotyping, hostility, or conspiracy theories outlined in guidelines 2 and 3. It does not depict Jews as possessing inherent negative traits or link them to evil forces; rather, it references historical facts about Nazi persecution of Jews.

5. **Coded Speech Considerations:** There is no indication that coded language targeting Jews or Jewish institutions is being used in this tweet.

According to the IHRA, antisemitism can include making mendacious (false), dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective group. In this tweet, there is an implication that ""white power"" movements are inherently linked to violent and harmful actions against Jews by referring to it as ""a KKK call to lynch blacks and Jews."" This suggests a stereotype of such groups as having antisemitic intent or actions, which can be seen as demonizing and dehumanizing.

Furthermore, the tweet contrasts this with ""Black Power,"" framing it positively and in stark contrast to ""white power,"" thereby implicitly reinforcing negative stereotypes about white supremacy movements. While not directly calling for violence against Jews in the tweet itself, the association made between white supremacist ideology (often linked with antisemitic beliefs) and actions like lynching contributes to a harmful perception of such groups.

Overall, while the primary focus of the tweet is on comparing two ideologies, it perpetuates stereotypes about ""white power"" that align with the IHRA's examples of how antisemitism can manifest in public discourse.",No,"The tweet in question makes a comparison between ""White power"" and ""Black Power,"" emphasizing that the former is associated with violence against both blacks and Jews, while the latter calls for equal protection under the law. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions.

In this context, the tweet does not exhibit any form of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence towards Jews or Jewish institutions. Instead, it contrasts two movements by highlighting their differing objectives and historical associations with respect to racial issues, where ""White power"" is linked with harmful acts against both blacks and Jews. The tweet's mention of Jewish individuals in this context appears to be factual rather than derogatory or conspiratorial.

The tweet does not engage in any of the antisemitic behaviors outlined by the JDA guidelines:

Would you try to educate him? Or would you conclude that your teacher was an unapologetic anti-Semite. Could you continue the relationship?,Yes,"According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, denying or minimizing the Holocaust is considered a manifestation of antisemitism. The tweet presents a hypothetical scenario where a teacher claims that the Holocaust was fabricated by Jews to advance Zionist objectives. This claim directly aligns with one of the examples outlined in the IHRA definition: ""Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations"" and ""Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g., gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany during World War II (the Holocaust)."" 

The scenario described in the tweet involves suggesting that Jews might have invented the Holocaust for political gain. This is a stereotype and misrepresentation aimed at undermining the historical truth of the Holocaust, an act which serves to delegitimize Jewish suffering and memory. Such statements can be seen as part of a pattern that spreads false narratives about Jewish influence or motivations, aligning with mendacious and demonizing allegations highlighted in the IHRA definition.

Moreover, labeling such individuals as ""unapologetic anti-Semites"" underscores the perception of antisemitism inherent in the described behavior. The tweet's content reflects an understanding that denying the Holocaust is not merely a historical dispute but a harmful antisemitic act because it perpetuates dangerous stereotypes and contributes to discrimination against Jewish people.

Therefore, according to the IHRA working definition, the hypothetical situation presented in the tweet would be considered antisemitic.",No,"The tweet in question presents a hypothetical scenario where someone is confronted with Holocaust denial—the assertion that the deliberate genocide of Jews by Nazis during World War II did not occur. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), specifically guideline 5, denying or minimizing the Holocaust is considered antisemitic. This includes claims that there were no extermination camps or gas chambers and assertions about the number of victims being significantly lower than established historical facts.

In this tweet, the scenario does not involve the person directly making a claim to deny the Holocaust; rather, it poses an example in which someone might encounter such denial from another party (e.g., a teacher). The question posed in the tweet is whether one should try to educate the teacher or conclude that they are an anti-Semite.

The hypothetical nature of the scenario and its framing as a rhetorical question do not constitute direct antisemitism under JDA guidelines. Instead, it highlights the dilemma someone might face when encountering Holocaust denial, encouraging reflection on how to respond to such claims. This does not align with performing or promoting antisemitic acts but rather addresses the challenge of responding appropriately to them.

Therefore, while the scenario involves a discussion related to antisemitism (specifically Holocaust denial), the tweet itself is neither an endorsement nor an execution of antisemitic beliefs or actions according to JDA definitions.",1,0,1,0,0,0

Additionally, it includes ""denying the fact, scope, mechanisms, or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters during World War II (the Holocaust).""

The tweet in question criticizes someone for finding amusement in the mass extermination of Jews during the Holocaust. This implies that such an attitude trivializes or undermines the gravity and reality of the Holocaust, which can be linked to denying its seriousness or intentionality. Even though the tweet itself does not explicitly deny the Holocaust or suggest it was exaggerated or fabricated, it addresses a mindset that could be perceived as diminishing the genocide's significance.

Moreover, by expressing disbelief at someone treating such a tragic event with levity, especially a U.S. military officer who should presumably uphold values of respect and dignity, the tweet implicitly points to attitudes that can contribute to an environment where Holocaust denial or minimization is tolerated. This aligns with aspects of antisemitism as outlined in the IHRA definition because it relates to how the memory and reality of the Holocaust are perceived and treated.

Therefore, based on the context provided by the IHRA's examples and definitions, the tweet can be considered reflective of attitudes that contribute to antisemitic sentiment.",No,"The tweet in question expresses confusion and disapproval regarding the amusement of someone (specifically mentioned as a US military officer) over the mass extermination of Jews during the Holocaust.

The tweet does not make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews or attribute inherent character traits to them. It also does not associate Jews with evil forces, propagate stereotypes, or express hostility towards Jewish people or their institutions.

Importantly, it does not deny, minimize, or distort the Holocaust, which is explicitly identified in the JDA as an antisemitic act (guideline 5). Instead, the tweet seems to be a critique of insensitivity or inappropriate humor related to historical atrocities, specifically those targeting Jews during the Holocaust. This kind of critique can be seen as a condemnation of inappropriate attitudes or behavior rather than an expression of antisemitism.

1. **Use of Symbolism**: The term ""Jezziah"" is a play on words that references Jesus, whose Jewish heritage is historically recognized but often downplayed in certain narratives. By targeting this age group with an allusion to ""Jesus,"" the tweet invokes imagery linked to classic antisemitic stereotypes.

2. **Connotations of Hostility**: The language of ""turning its guns"" suggests hostility and aggression towards a specific demographic, which can be perceived as antisemitic if it implies animosity toward Jews because of their association with Jesus' age group.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: Without additional context or the content linked in the tweet, the reference to ""Jezziah"" coupled with aggressive language could suggest an underlying bias against Jewish people by connecting them with a controversial or contentious topic related to religious figures.

4. **Targeting Based on Perceived Association**: By singling out this specific age group, the tweet may be perceived as targeting Jews under the guise of criticizing a broader demographic, which aligns with antisemitic behavior that holds Jews collectively responsible for various issues or traits.

Overall, while not explicit in every element of the IHRA definition, the tweet's implicit associations and aggressive rhetoric can contribute to an environment that fosters antisemitism.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze its content in light of the guidelines provided.

1. **Essentializing or Generalizations**: The tweet does not appear to make sweeping generalizations about Jews as a group or essentialize any characteristics of Jews. It refers to ""the crank left"" and their actions, without attributing these actions to Jews collectively or suggesting inherent traits among them.

2. **Linkage to Evil or Conspiracy**: The tweet does not link Jews to evil, suggest a Jewish conspiracy, or attribute hidden powers to Jews as outlined in guideline 2. There is no indication that the tweet portrays Jews as controlling forces behind negative actions or events.

3. **Manifestation in Words, Images, or Deeds**: There are no antisemitic words, visual images, or deeds described in the tweet according to guideline 3. The language used does not depict Jews negatively or incite hostility against them.

4. **Direct or Indirect Coded Speech**: While some might interpret ""Jezziah"" as a coded reference (potentially linking to Jesus and, by extension, indirectly referring to Judaism), there is no explicit antisemitic content. The tweet criticizes a political group (""the crank left"") rather than Jews specifically.

5. **Holocaust Denial or Minimization**: There is no mention of the Holocaust, denial of its occurrence, or minimization of its impact in the tweet.

6. **Israel and Palestine Context**: The tweet does not reference Israel, Zionism, or Jewish responsibility for Israeli actions, so guidelines 6-10 are not applicable here.

7. **Legitimate Criticism or Political Expression**: The tweet appears to be a critique of certain political positions or behavior within a specific group (""the crank left"") and not an expression targeting Jews as a collective based on their identity. This aligns more closely with guideline 15, which states that contentious or excessive criticism is not inherently antisemitic.

This aligns with several aspects of the IHRA definition of antisemitism:

1. **Mendacious Allegations:** By highlighting a very obscure historical instance without context (there were indeed some Jews who joined the Nazis, but they represented an insignificant and coerced minority), the tweet may suggest that Jewish support for Nazi ideology was more widespread than it actually was. This can be seen as making dehumanizing or demonizing claims about Jews.

2. **Conspiracy Myth:** The mention of a ""Jews for Hitler"" group could imply, even if indirectly, that there was significant Jewish involvement with the Nazis at an organizational level, feeding into stereotypes or myths of Jewish complicity in evil schemes against humanity.

3. **Distortion of Historical Facts:** Such statements can contribute to the minimization or distortion of historical facts about the Holocaust by suggesting that some Jews supported Nazi ideologies, which diverts from the reality of widespread persecution and genocide faced by Jews during this period.

4. **Intent and Perception:** Even if not explicitly antisemitic in wording, such tweets may be perceived as intending to harm or ridicule Jewish people collectively, aligning with how contemporary antisemitism can manifest through speech and writing.

In summary, while the tweet does refer to a historical fact, its framing can perpetuate harmful myths and stereotypes about Jews, fitting within several elements of the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this tweet as antisemitic based on how it could be interpreted in context.",No,"The tweet mentions the existence of a ""Jews for Hitler"" group in early Nazi Germany, which is a historically documented fact. This reference does not inherently embody discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as individuals or Jewish institutions simply because they are Jewish. Instead, it acknowledges a historical occurrence without attributing inherent negative characteristics to Jews.

According to the guidelines of the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews or linking them inherently with evil forces. The tweet does not engage in such essentializing or generalization. Instead, it provides a factual statement that can be verified through historical research.

Moreover, presenting a fact without derogatory implications or context suggesting conspiracy or malicious intent aligns with the JDA's guideline on indirect expressions of antisemitism; this tweet lacks such an implication. The statement does not perpetuate any anti-Jewish stereotypes, suggest Jewish control over governments or media (as mentioned in guidelines 2 and 4), nor does it deny or minimize the Holocaust, which is explicitly antisemitic per guideline 5.

The content could be sensitive due to its association with a horrific historical period; however, without additional context implying malicious intent or harmful stereotypes, it does not meet the JDA's criteria for antisemitism.

This determination is based on several aspects outlined by the IHRA guidelines:

1. **Demonization and Stereotyping**: The tweet implies a stereotype about Jews being divided along political lines (specifically ""right-wing""), potentially leading to harmful generalizations or accusations against them. By highlighting internal divisions within Jewish communities in a negative light, it might contribute to a perception of Jews as inherently problematic or conflicted.

2. **Conspiracy and Internal Division**: Suggesting that there are significant disagreements among Jews (""what right wing jews say about other jews"") plays into the antisemitic trope of depicting Jews as internally divided, which can be used to undermine their unity or credibility. This aligns with the IHRA definition's reference to attributing negative traits and conspiracies to Jewish people.

3. **Mendacious Allegations**: Without context, the tweet may encourage viewers to expect dehumanizing or derogatory content in the linked material, feeding into antisemitic narratives or stereotypes about Jews. The lack of direct evidence but implication of discord can be seen as a form of mendacious allegation against Jewish communities.

While this assessment relies on interpreting the implications and potential effects of the tweet within the context provided by the IHRA definition, it is crucial to recognize that assessing whether specific content constitutes antisemitism requires careful consideration of intent, context, and perception. However, based on these factors, the tweet aligns with elements outlined in the IHRA's examples of contemporary antisemitic expressions.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze it against the definition and guidelines provided by the JDA.

1. **Definition Analysis**: The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence specifically targeting Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish. It also highlights that essentializing characteristics of Jews or making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews are forms of antisemitism.

2. **Guideline 1 Consideration**: This guideline warns against essentializing or making sweeping negative generalizations about a given population, which is racist and applicable to antisemitism specifically. However, the tweet does not make any inherent character trait claims or broad generalizations about all Jews; it references ""right-wing Jews,"" which suggests a particular subgroup rather than an entire group.

3. **Guideline 2 Consideration**: This guideline focuses on linking Jews to evil or conspiracy theories. The tweet does not suggest that right-wing Jews are linked to the forces of evil, engage in conspiracies, or possess hidden power.

4. **General Guidelines Application**: The tweet mentions ""right-wing Jews"" and their views about other Jews but does not imply any discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against them as a group. It suggests an interest in what one subgroup within the Jewish community might say about another, which is more of a commentary on intra-group dynamics rather than an antisemitic statement.

5. **Contextual Judgment**: While it's crucial to understand context when assessing coded speech (Guideline 4), without additional negative or harmful context implying hostility towards Jews as a whole group, the tweet itself does not meet the criteria for being codedly antisemitic according to the JDA guidelines.

By referring to the police force as ""tasked to bully Orthodox Jews,"" the tweet suggests that these individuals are inherently deserving of mistreatment or oppression by law enforcement, which is a form of dehumanizing portrayal.

Additionally, the phrase ""bend a knee to terrorists"" implies a negative stereotype about Jewish people being subservient to violent actors. This insinuates an alignment with terrorism without providing evidence or context and taps into broader antisemitic tropes that suggest undue influence or control by Jews in matters of security or governance.

The tweet also lacks specificity regarding the nature of the interaction between police and individuals, which might otherwise provide a valid critique if it were framed as criticism of state actions rather than an implicit attack on Jewish people. Instead, it generalizes negatively about Orthodox Jews without addressing specific behaviors or situations. This aligns with the IHRA definition's concern over ""mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations.""

Overall, while not explicitly using classic antisemitic language or symbols, the tweet perpetuates negative stereotypes and characterizations that fit within the broader patterns of antisemitism as defined by IHRA.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, we must evaluate it against the provided definitions and examples.

1. **Discrimination, Prejudice, Hostility, or Violence Against Jews as Jews**: The tweet criticizes a police force for how they treat Orthodox Jews and deal with terrorists but does not explicitly attribute these actions to an inherent trait of Jews or Jewish institutions. It does express frustration over what is perceived as the treatment of Orthodox Jews by authorities.

2. **Sweeping Negative Generalizations (Guideline 1)**: The tweet criticizes a specific action (police behavior) and does not generalize about all Jews, nor does it link them to negative traits or actions inherently. It focuses on an incident rather than making broad claims about Jewish people as a group.

3. **Linkage of Jews to Evil (Guideline 2)**: The tweet does not suggest that Jews are linked to evil forces or imply any conspiracy involving Jewish individuals wielding hidden power against others.

4. **Manifestation in Words, Visual Images, and Deeds (Guideline 3)**: While the tweet uses strong language, it doesn't employ antisemitic tropes like depicting Jews with stereotypical imagery or attributing wealth, stinginess, or disloyalty to them.

5. **Coded Speech and Contextual Judgement (Guidelines 4 & 5)**: The tweet does not use coded speech about Jewish control over institutions nor does it deny the Holocaust or minimize its impact. It is focused on a specific context regarding police actions in a particular situation without broader antisemitic implications.

The critique in the tweet pertains to what is perceived as an inappropriate action by a police force and does not fit any of the antisemitic categories outlined by the JDA guidelines. The language, while critical of authorities in their treatment of Orthodox Jews and response to terrorists, lacks the elements that would classify it as antisemitic under the JDA framework.

1. **Stereotyping and Generalizations**: The quote from the Quran is used to generalize that Jews (and Christians) will never be satisfied unless Muslims follow their religion. This statement itself might not inherently express hatred, but its use in this context implies a negative perception by suggesting an intrinsic oppositional stance of Jews towards others.

2. **Contextual Implication**: Although the tweet also mentions ""Double Standards,"" it connects these standards specifically with the restoration of Hagia Sophia and implies dissatisfaction from religious groups (Jews and Christians) as expected or problematic. This indirectly supports antisemitic narratives by suggesting a collective Jewish disapproval is inherently negative and untrustworthy.

3. **Conspiracy-like Allegations**: The tweet hints at Jews being part of an oppositional force without specific evidence, aligning with the IHRA definition's concern about attributing to Jews conspiratorial roles or collective blame in broader socio-political contexts.

4. **Blame and Hostility**: By using a religious text to substantiate expected opposition from Jews, the tweet fosters a perception that frames Jewish actions or opinions as antagonistic, aligning with antisemitic tendencies of blaming Jews for conflict or dissatisfaction within societal decisions.

Thus, considering these elements in light of the IHRA definition, the tweet can be seen as promoting an antisemitic narrative by perpetuating negative stereotypes and collective blame.",No,"**

The tweet references a Quranic verse to express opposition to Turkey's decision regarding the Hagia Sophia Mosque and highlights perceived double standards. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions.

1. **Direct Reference to Judaism:** The tweet does not directly target Jews or Jewish institutions but rather mentions a Quranic verse involving both Jews and Christians in opposition to Turkey's actions. It doesn't engage with any of the core themes of antisemitism defined by the JDA, such as linking Jews to evil, conspiracies, or denying historical facts like the Holocaust.

2. **Context of Criticism:** The tweet appears to be a critique of international reactions and perceived double standards regarding Turkey's actions, not an expression of hostility towards Jews specifically. It draws on religious text interpretation rather than antisemitic tropes.

3. **Absence of Antisemitic Themes:** There is no mention or implication of Jewish conspiracy, control over governments, media, finance, or any other stereotypical antisemitic themes outlined in the JDA guidelines (e.g., guideline 2). The tweet does not attribute negative characteristics to Jews as a group.

4. **Coded Language and Implications:** Although the quote includes both Jews and Christians, it does not apply classical antisemitic stereotypes or imagery specific to Jews. The criticism is directed at international politics rather than Jews per se.

5. **Comparison with JDA Examples:** In comparison to examples in section B of the JDA that define potentially antisemitic actions (such as holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct), this tweet does not fit any of those scenarios related to Israel or collective Jewish responsibility.

While it may appear humorous on the surface, the content plays into negative stereotypes about Jews by trivializing their religious dietary laws. This type of humor can contribute to a perception that reinforces harmful stereotypes.

The IHRA definition includes making ""mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations"" about Jews as such or the power of Jews as a collective. The tweet fits into this category by making light of Jewish customs in a way that could be perceived as mocking or belittling. While it does not explicitly call for harm against Jews, it can contribute to an environment where antisemitic attitudes are normalized through humor.

Additionally, such content can indirectly support the idea that Jewish practices are trivial or absurd, which can feed into broader stereotypes and prejudices. In public discourse, especially on platforms like social media, this kind of mockery can perpetuate negative perceptions and contribute to a culture where antisemitism is more likely to be tolerated or dismissed as harmless humor.

Therefore, while not overtly harmful in the way that some other examples might be, it does align with aspects of the IHRA definition by engaging in stereotyping and potentially contributing to an environment where such views are normalized.",No,"The tweet in question uses humor to comment on Jewish dietary laws and the prohibition against eating pork, including bacon. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions.

1. **General Context**: The tweet doesn't express any form of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence towards Jews. Instead, it uses a light-hearted tone to discuss the dietary restriction that prohibits eating pork in Judaism. This aligns with guideline A.1 about essentializing character traits and making negative generalizations. Here, no negative trait is ascribed to Jews themselves; rather, it humorously acknowledges a religious practice.

2. **Hostility or Prejudice**: The tweet lacks any hostility or prejudicial language against Jewish people. It does not depict Jews in a derogatory manner nor attribute harmful stereotypes to them. Instead, it presents the dietary law with a playful approach and even jokes about adopting Judaism due to its restrictions on bacon, which could be interpreted as an ironic take rather than a negative commentary.

3. **Coded or Explicit Antisemitism**: The tweet does not exhibit coded antisemitic statements. It doesn’t imply any malicious intent, conspiracy theories, or portray Jews negatively beyond humorously referencing dietary laws. This aligns with guideline A.4, which discusses the context of coded speech—here, there is no hidden agenda against Jews.

4. **Cultural and Religious Context**: The comment about not eating pork is based on a well-known religious practice in Judaism. While it may seem to trivialize or mock this aspect of Jewish law, without additional context suggesting hostility or prejudice, the tweet falls within permissible cultural humor rather than antisemitism.

5. **Absence of Negative Stereotypes**: Guideline A.3 discusses antisemitic caricatures and stereotypes. The tweet does not perpetuate these; it doesn’t imply that all Jews are wealthy, stingy, unpatriotic, or any other negative stereotype common in antisemitic rhetoric.

This can be interpreted as minimizing or trivializing the experiences and concerns of Jewish individuals who reportedly faced antisemitism within the party at that time. By downplaying these valid issues, it indirectly contributes to a hostile environment for Jews, aligning with aspects of the IHRA definition that address both rhetorical manifestations of antisemitism and discrimination.

The tweet's tone implies dismissiveness toward the suffering or discrimination experienced by Jewish individuals due to its sarcastic dismissal (""let’s not""), which can be seen as an attempt to undermine their concerns. This approach could contribute to a broader narrative that marginalizes Jewish voices, echoing the IHRA examples where denying or minimizing experiences of antisemitism acts as a form of delegitimization.

Additionally, it uses this context to imply bias against the Labour Party, possibly leading readers to attribute negative connotations to Jews connected with political criticism, which can be seen as holding them collectively responsible for certain political actions or affiliations. This aligns with the IHRA definition concerning accusations or implications that unfairly target Jewish individuals based on collective identity.

In summary, while not overtly using classical antisemitic tropes or language, the tweet's dismissive attitude toward a legitimate concern of Jewish harassment can be interpreted as perpetuating an environment conducive to antisemitism according to the IHRA framework.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) definition, we must analyze it based on the provided guidelines. 

1. **General Discrimination or Hostility**: The tweet suggests reflecting on alleged harassment faced by Jews under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership of the UK Labour Party. This reflection does not inherently express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as individuals or Jewish institutions. It raises a point about possible past experiences of antisemitism without itself exhibiting discriminatory or hostile behavior.

2. **Essentializing or Generalizations**: The tweet does not essentialize Jews or make sweeping generalizations about them. Instead, it refers to specific instances where harassment might have occurred, focusing on these events rather than suggesting inherent negative traits about Jewish people.

3. **Linking Jews with Evil**: There is no content in the tweet that links Jews with evil forces, conspiracies, or stereotypes of hidden power and control over society, which are central themes in antisemitic rhetoric according to the JDA guidelines.

4. **Manifestation in Words, Images, or Deeds**: The tweet does not contain words, images, or deeds that portray Jews in a negative, stereotypical manner as described under the guidelines for manifesting antisemitism (such as depicting them as inherently stingy or associating them with wealth).

5. **Coded Language or Indirect Hostility**: While some might interpret the tweet's tone as dismissive (""Nah - let’s not""), this does not fit within the JDA’s definition of coded language that would make it antisemitic. The suggestion to ignore reflecting on harassment could be seen more as a rhetorical device rather than an indirect form of hostility.

6. **Israel and Palestine Context**: The tweet makes no mention of Israel or the Palestinian context, so guidelines specific to these topics are not applicable here.

7. **Denial of Holocaust or Minimization**: There is no content in the tweet that denies or minimizes the Holocaust, a key indicator of antisemitism according to the JDA.

The tweet mentions ""Pro-Palestinian protesters harass Jews in NYC,"" which can be interpreted through the lens of the IHRA working definition of antisemitism. While the tweet itself does not explicitly contain any antisemitic content, it is important to consider the context and implications.

1. **Harassment Based on Jewish Identity:** The mention of ""harass Jews"" suggests targeting individuals based on their Jewish identity. This aligns with the IHRA definition, which considers harassment towards Jewish people as a manifestation of antisemitism when it stems from prejudice against Jews.

2. **Contextual Implications:** If the harassment is rooted in or linked to anti-Jewish sentiments—such as blaming Jews for broader political issues related to Israel—the tweet could reflect an underlying antisemitic attitude. The IHRA definition notes that criticism of Israel should not be regarded as antisemitic unless it crosses into attributing collective blame to Jewish people globally.

3. **Potential for Stereotyping or Demonization:** If the harassment involves stereotypical allegations, demonization, or dehumanizing behaviors towards Jews (as outlined in the IHRA examples), this would strengthen the argument that the situation described is antisemitic.

4. **Physical and Rhetorical Manifestations:** The tweet implies a physical manifestation of harassment, which could be considered an antisemitic act if it specifically targets Jewish individuals or institutions due to their identity.

In summary, while the tweet does not explicitly state any antisemitic content, the implication that Jews are being harassed by protesters can align with elements of the IHRA definition. If this harassment is based on prejudice against Jews, either as individuals or in relation to broader political issues involving Israel, it would be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA criteria.",No,"** 

To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze it in light of the provided definition and guidelines. The tweet states, ""Pro-Palestinian protesters harass Jews in NYC,"" which describes an incident involving harassment against individuals identified as Jewish.

1. **Definition Analysis**: According to the JDA's definition, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews because they are Jewish (or Jewish institutions due to their Jewish identity). The tweet mentions harassment of Jews but does not provide evidence or context suggesting that this harassment was motivated by prejudice against Jews as a group, rather than perhaps opposition to political views associated with Israel.

2. **Guidelines A and B**: None of the antisemitic criteria listed in these sections are directly evident from the tweet itself:
   - The tweet does not essentialize Jews, associate them with evil or conspiracy (Guideline 2), nor use stereotypes or symbols typical of antisemitism (Guideline 6).
   - It doesn't hold all Jews responsible for Israeli actions or policies (Guideline 7) or require a collective public stance from Jewish individuals on Israel-related matters (Guideline 8).

3. **Context Consideration**: While the tweet implies harassment, it lacks context about whether this harassment was based on antisemitic motives or simply opposition to political views related to Zionism or Israeli policy (as noted in Guideline 12). The JDA emphasizes that criticism of Israel is not inherently antisemitic, which implies that actions taken against individuals for perceived support of Israel might not be.

4. **Guidelines C**: Criticism or protest targeting specific political stances can occur without being antisemitic, especially when directed at state policies rather than ethnic or religious identity (Guideline 13). The tweet does not provide enough information to suggest that the harassment was specifically due to antisemitic reasons as opposed to opposition related to Israeli politics.

In conclusion, based solely on the content of the tweet and without additional context indicating a broader antisemitic intent or action beyond harassment, it cannot be classified as antisemitic under the JDA's definitions.",1,0,1,0,0,0

1. **Use of Terms with Hostile Connotations**: The terms ""RACISM"" and ""ANTI-SEMITSIM"" are used together, implying a shared or equivalent nature between racism and antisemitism as experienced by the tweet's author. This framing can potentially minimize the specific historical and contemporary experiences of Jews.

2. **Misuse of Emoji to Denigrate Jewish Identity**: The mention of ""JEW emojis"" being part of racist behavior can be interpreted as a misuse or trivialization of Jewish identity, reducing it to stereotypes or symbols associated with racism.

3. **Labeling Individuals as ""JEWS"" in a Hostile Manner**: If the context implies that people are calling someone derogatorily “a Jew” or identifying others as Jews for hostile reasons, this can be seen as targeting individuals based on their Jewish identity, which aligns with antisemitic behavior.

4. **Mischaracterization of ""GROYPER""**: While ""Groyper"" is a term used to describe certain supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump, its misuse in the tweet suggests it as a synonym for ""racist."" If this connection is drawn without context or if it falsely equates Groyper ideology with antisemitism without basis, it could contribute to misunderstandings and stereotypes about Jewish communities.

5. **Overall Context of Hostility**: The overall tone of the tweet may suggest an environment where hostility towards Jews or Jewish symbols is tolerated or justified, which aligns with creating a hostile atmosphere that can lead to discrimination against individuals perceived as Jewish.

Considering these elements together, the tweet reflects several aspects of antisemitism defined by IHRA, particularly in how it targets and characterizes Jewish identity, both symbolically and directly. Therefore, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet could be seen as expressing or contributing to antisemitic sentiment.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must analyze its content in light of the provided definition and guidelines.

1. **Definition**: The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. It involves generalizations about Jews that lead to their dehumanization or demonization.

2. **Guideline 3** (manifestations): This includes negative utterances and actions directed specifically at Jews because they are Jews.

In the tweet:
- The user mentions being called ""JEWS"" by others and references ""JEW emojis,"" suggesting an experience of harassment or offensive labeling.
- There is a reference to ""GROYPER"" as a nickname for a racist, which does not inherently indicate antisemitism unless linked explicitly to attacks on Jews.

The key point here is the context in which these terms are used. The tweet appears to be highlighting experiences of racism and antisemitism faced by the individual, rather than perpetuating any form of hostility or prejudice against Jews. 

Moreover:
- There's no explicit language of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence towards Jews.
- It does not contain generalizations about Jews as a group that fit the description in guideline 2 (e.g., linking Jews to evil forces).
  
The tweet seems to be a personal expression concerning how they perceive being targeted. However, without additional context indicating that this perception is based on actual antisemitic actions or rhetoric from others, it does not itself constitute an act of antisemitism according to the JDA.

Thus, while the individual in the tweet may feel subject to racism and antisemitism, the content of the tweet itself lacks explicit antisemitic elements as defined by the JDA.",1,0,1,0,0,0

She (Palestine) will be with me as a Congresswoman"" - Rashida Tlaib https://t.co/M3Rqqquxiv",Yes,"The tweet references Rashida Tlaib's statements about her connection to Palestine and mentions animated videos of real murders being recreated for children’s programs. To determine if this is antisemitic according to the IHRA definition, we need to consider several aspects:

1. **Targeting Jews or Jewish Institutions**: The mention of ""real murders of Israeli Jews"" indicates a focus on violence against individuals identified as Jewish based on their association with Israel. This can be seen as targeting Jews collectively due to their connection with the state of Israel.

2. **Use of Stereotypes and Demonization**: Although not explicitly stated in the tweet, implying that such violent acts are being normalized or made acceptable through children's programming could contribute to a dehumanizing portrayal of Israeli Jews. This aligns with the IHRA definition’s point about using stereotypical allegations that can demonize Jewish people.

3. **Double Standards and Comparisons**: The context may suggest double standards by comparing these programs to what might be expected if similar content targeted any other group or nationality, potentially invoking a form of bias against Jews.

4. **Overall Context and Perception**: According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves a perception that can express hatred toward Jews. If the tweet is perceived as condoning violence against Israeli Jews in a manner not applied to others, it might foster an environment where Jews are viewed antagonistically or blamed for broader conflicts.

While the tweet does not explicitly contain all elements of the IHRA definition, its context and implications can contribute to a perception that aligns with antisemitic attitudes by targeting Jewish individuals through their association with Israel. Therefore, it could be interpreted as contributing to an environment that fosters such perceptions.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, antisemitism is defined as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish. In this context, the tweet in question mentions Rashida Tlaib and refers to her passion for justice being rooted in Palestine, which she describes as not yet free. The tweet then discusses animated videos of real murders of Israeli Jews recreated for children's programs.

1. **Directness**: The content of the tweet itself does not directly express hostility or discrimination against Jewish individuals or institutions simply because they are Jewish. It criticizes a form of media presentation rather than targeting Jews as an ethnic or religious group.

2. **Guideline 3**: While this guideline mentions antisemitic deeds including actions like attacking synagogues, assaulting someone due to their Jewish identity, etc., the tweet does not fall into these categories of direct action against Jewish individuals or institutions.

3. **Guidelines on Israel and Palestine (B)**: The JDA acknowledges that certain criticisms specifically directed at Israel can be antisemitic if they employ traditional anti-Jewish stereotypes or treat Jews as a monolithic group responsible for actions of the Israeli state (e.g., guidelines 6-9). However, the tweet criticizes specific media representations rather than attributing blame to Jewish people collectively.

4. **Guidelines on Non-Antisemitic Criticism (C)**: The JDA specifies that criticizing Israel as a state or its policies does not inherently constitute antisemitism. Guideline 13 allows for evidence-based criticism of Israeli policies, which can be interpreted as the tweet's focus on particular media portrayals rather than an attack on Jewish people per se.

5. **Context and Intent**: The tweet does not appear to use coded language implying Jews collectively control or are inherently responsible for specific negative actions (Guideline 4). It focuses on a single issue—the portrayal of violence in children’s programming—and associates this with Tlaib's political perspective, without suggesting that Jewish people as a whole should be held accountable.

But not significantly greater or lesser than their share of the population\n\nThe reason ppl get uptight about anti semetism is there's a lot of groups who aren't as reasonable...",Yes,"The tweet appears to be antisemitic according to the IHRA definition of antisemitism due to several key elements it contains:

1. **Implying Conspiratorial Influence**: The statement ""Jews did play a part"" suggests an implication that Jews have some undue or hidden influence or role in broader societal issues, which aligns with the IHRA's warning against attributing conspiratorial power to Jews.

2. **Minimizing Historical Context**: By stating that Jews did not play a significantly greater or lesser role than their population share, the tweet dismisses historical contexts where Jews have been disproportionately affected by hate and persecution, including the Holocaust. This can contribute to downplaying the severity of antisemitism, which is problematic in itself.

3. **Trivializing Sensitivities**: The mention that ""ppl get uptight about anti-semitism"" trivializes legitimate concerns about antisemitism. It suggests that sensitivity towards antisemitic expressions might be overblown or unreasonable, which can undermine the seriousness of combating such discrimination.

Overall, the tweet embodies elements of minimizing and misrepresenting Jewish history and contributions to societal issues in a way that aligns with certain manifestations of antisemitism as defined by the IHRA. It suggests an undercurrent of stereotyping or conspiracy thinking, even if it does not explicitly state harmful intent.",No,"** To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to evaluate it against the provided definition and guidelines.

1. **Definition Review:** The JDA defines antisemitism as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. It involves essentializing or making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews as a group.

2. **Tweet Content Analysis:**
   - The tweet mentions that ""Jews did play a part"" in something unspecified but suggests their involvement is proportional to their population size (""not significantly greater or lesser than their share of the population""). This indicates an attempt to counteract accusations of disproportionate influence, which can be seen as addressing a common antisemitic stereotype.
   - The statement acknowledges that some people might ""get uptight"" about antisemitism, indicating awareness of the sensitivity around these issues.

3. **Guidelines Application:**
   - **Guideline 1** concerns essentializing or making sweeping generalizations. The tweet avoids this by asserting that Jewish involvement is proportional to their population share, not disproportionately influential.
   - **Guideline 2** highlights linking Jews with evil and conspiracies. There is no indication in the tweet of such a linkage; rather, it attempts to normalize Jewish participation as typical for any demographic group.
   - The tweet does not exhibit hostility or prejudice against Jews; instead, it seems to argue against overblown claims about Jewish influence.

4. **Conclusion:** The tweet neither discriminates nor manifests hostility towards Jews. It addresses concerns about antisemitism and counters a stereotype by suggesting Jewish involvement is proportional, which aligns with reasonable debate as per the JDA's guidelines. Therefore, according to the JDA definition and context provided, the tweet is not antisemitic.

1. **Context and Implication**: The tweet references a historical period when the systematic mass-murder of Jews, known as the Holocaust, was occurring under Nazi orders. By mentioning Joseph Goebbels' campaign for ""more politeness in public life"" during this time, it juxtaposes a trivial societal norm against the backdrop of genocide, which can be seen as minimizing or mocking the gravity and horror of the events.

2. **Demonization and Stereotyping**: Although not overtly using traditional antisemitic stereotypes (such as blood libel), the insinuation here is that despite the atrocities being committed, a focus on civility was prioritized. This can be interpreted as implying that Jews were to blame for this focus on superficial societal norms, thereby employing a form of demonization or stereotyping about Jewish influence.

3. **Denial and Minimization**: By highlighting Goebbels' campaign in such a manner without context, the tweet could contribute to Holocaust denial or minimization, which is explicitly mentioned as antisemitic under the IHRA definition. It denies the full scope and intentionality of the genocide by shifting focus away from the atrocities themselves.

4. **Historical Sensitivity**: The reference to this specific historical period requires sensitivity. Any statement that appears to trivialize or distort the historical reality of the Holocaust can perpetuate harmful narratives and contribute to an environment where antisemitism thrives.

In summary, while the tweet does not explicitly use traditional antisemitic language, its context, implications, and potential impact align with the IHRA definition's criteria for antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question references historical facts regarding Joseph Goebbels and the Nazi regime during World War II, specifically mentioning the ""Final Solution"" and its context. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions.

1. **Historical Context**: The tweet provides a historical account rather than expressing any form of contemporary prejudice, hostility, or discrimination towards Jews. It does not make generalizations about Jews today but refers to specific actions by the Nazi regime in the past.

2. **Intent and Content**: The content focuses on an example of irony and propaganda used by Joseph Goebbels. There is no indication that it expresses antisemitic sentiment, nor does it apply stereotypes or negative imagery related to Jews in a modern context.

3. **Application of JDA Guidelines**:
   - **Guideline 5** mentions denial or minimization of the Holocaust as antisemitic. The tweet does not deny or minimize the Holocaust; rather, it acknowledges the systematic mass-murder of millions of Jews.
   - **Other guidelines** address modern discrimination or prejudice against Jews or Jewish institutions, none of which apply to this historical reference.

4. **Intent and Interpretation**: While the interpretation of such statements can vary based on context, in this case, the tweet does not appear to target or malign contemporary Jews or Jewish communities. It is a factual recounting intended to highlight the contrast between Nazi propaganda and their actions during that period.

Here it is to intimidate those who support #BLM. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FREE COUNTRY. Seems not any more. #Fascism,Yes,"The tweet in question implies an analogy between the historical actions of Hitler's regime and current events related to Black Lives Matter (BLM) supporters, suggesting that both involve intimidation tactics against targeted groups. While the tweet explicitly compares a contemporary event with Nazi-era practices, it does not directly use language or symbols traditionally associated with antisemitism as defined by the IHRA.

However, the comparison itself can be seen as problematic under the IHRA definition because it involves drawing parallels between Israeli policies and those of Nazis (one of the examples provided in the IHRA working definition). By likening actions against BLM supporters to tactics used by Hitler against Jews, the tweet indirectly equates a modern social movement with Jewish suffering during the Holocaust. This can perpetuate harmful stereotypes or comparisons that diminish the unique historical context of antisemitism and the Holocaust.

The tweet’s broader implication is that it uses a historically charged event (Hitler's actions against Jews) as an intimidation tactic against another group, which aligns with how antisemitism might exploit such historical references to create fear or prejudice. Even though the target in this instance is not Jewish, the misuse of Nazi comparisons can contribute to an environment where antisemitic rhetoric and analogies are normalized.

Therefore, while the tweet does not explicitly demonstrate antisemitic content by directly targeting Jews or Jewish symbols, its use of Nazi-era comparisons aligns with patterns recognized under the IHRA definition as potentially antisemitic due to their insinuations and the context in which such historical references can perpetuate harmful ideologies.",No,"** The tweet in question compares the act of troops marching down city streets to intimidate supporters of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement with how Hitler increased his forces to intimidate Jews. While this comparison invokes historical events associated with antisemitism and fascism, it does not explicitly target Jews or Jewish institutions as such. 

According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions because they are Jewish. The tweet focuses its critique on a contemporary political issue—the intimidation of BLM supporters—and uses historical context as an analogy rather than specifically directing hostility towards Jews or Jewish entities.

Furthermore, the JDA distinguishes between antisemitism and legitimate criticism or analogies involving Israel or broader political contexts (guideline 13). While comparisons to Nazi Germany can be contentious and potentially problematic depending on their usage and context, the tweet does not appear to meet the criteria of antisemitism as defined by the JDA because it does not express discrimination or hostility towards Jews or Jewish institutions.

However, it's important to consider that while this analysis concludes the tweet is not antisemitic according to the JDA definition, such analogies can be sensitive and may be perceived differently based on context, intent, and audience reception. The comparison could potentially trivialize historical events of extreme violence against Jews if perceived as equating different levels or kinds of oppression without nuance.

In my view, Muslims who revere Allah should worship him directly,\nhttps://t.co/7SJjaRM8iM https://t.co/ovVLgMUMiw",Yes,"** The tweet can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA definition due to several factors:

1. **Misleading Interpretation and Contextual Manipulation**: The tweet accuses the original content of misleadingly quoting a verse from the Quran, specifically 5:32, suggesting it's directed against Jews as ""the Children of Israel."" This act may contribute to spreading stereotypical or dehumanizing views by implying that religious texts encourage violence against Jews. While this alone does not constitute antisemitism, it contributes to an environment where such perceptions are fostered.

2. **Accusation and Blame**: The tweet suggests that Muslims who revere Allah should worship him directly instead of following what the individual interprets as a commandment for violence. This could be seen as attributing harmful intentions or actions towards Jews (or infidels more generally) to Islamic teachings, which may align with stereotypical allegations about Jewish conspiracy theories or blame.

3. **Potential for Spreading Hate**: By asserting that certain interpretations of religious texts advocate brutal acts against non-Muslims (and implying this is linked to a group's belief system), the tweet indirectly supports narratives that could justify hatred or violence against Jews, thus fitting into manifestations of antisemitism as described by IHRA.

4. **Broader Implications**: Although not directly targeting Jewish individuals or communities, the implications of such interpretations can fuel antisemitic sentiments by perpetuating harmful stereotypes about religious extremism and its purported justifications for violence. This aligns with the broader examples provided by the IHRA definition regarding how such perceptions may express hatred towards Jews.

In summary, while the tweet does not explicitly target Jews or Jewish institutions, its implications and potential to reinforce harmful stereotypes and narratives can be seen as fitting within the scope of antisemitism as defined by the IHRA.",No,"To determine if the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we must assess it against the definition and guidelines provided.

1. **Definition of Antisemitism**: According to the JDA, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions. The tweet criticizes certain interpretations of Islamic scripture without explicitly targeting Jews as a group or making negative generalizations about them. It does not express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews specifically.

2. **Guidelines A**: The tweet does not essentialize Jews by attributing inherent character traits to them or make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews. Additionally, it does not link Jews with forces of evil or imply a Jewish conspiracy. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria outlined in guidelines 1 and 2.

3. **Guidelines B**: The tweet does not apply classical antisemitic symbols, images, or stereotypes to Israel or treat Jews as collectively responsible for any actions attributed to Muslims. It also does not demand that Jews condemn anything specific related to Israel or Zionism, nor does it assume Jewish loyalty issues based on their religion.

4. **Guidelines C**: The tweet is a critique of certain interpretations within Islam and does not constitute evidence-based criticism of the State of Israel or its policies. It neither supports nor critiques Israeli state actions in any antisemitic context.

Overall, while the tweet may be controversial due to its interpretation of religious texts, it does not exhibit antisemitism as defined by the JDA.

Here are several reasons why:

1. **Context of Minimizing Antisemitism**: The statement ""Do Jews who are marked more visibly as Jews by clothing, hair etc. experience more anti-Jewish hatred? No doubt."" acknowledges the reality of visible antisemitism but follows with a comparison to white privilege, which could be perceived as minimizing or trivializing the unique and pervasive nature of antisemitic experiences.

2. **Implication of Equivalence**: By juxtaposing visible Jewish identity markers and the concept of ""white privilege,"" the tweet suggests an equivalence between the two, potentially undermining the specific historical and systemic nature of antisemitism. This can contribute to a narrative that shifts focus away from the distinct forms of discrimination faced by Jews.

3. **Complexity in Addressing Antisemitism**: The final part of the tweet mentions ""It's sometimes complicated for Jews when white supremacists want +,"" which is incomplete but implies a complexity or challenge related to Jewish identity within contexts involving white supremacy. This could be interpreted as suggesting that Jews have a problematic relationship with issues of racism, potentially deflecting from their experiences as victims of hate.

4. **Potential for Stereotyping**: The tweet risks perpetuating stereotypes about Jewish identity being linked more to external markers than intrinsic elements of discrimination or privilege dynamics. This can contribute to the dehumanization and stereotypical portrayal mentioned in the IHRA definition.

Overall, while the tweet may not explicitly express hatred towards Jews, its potential to minimize antisemitism and complicate Jewish experiences within broader discussions about racism could align with certain aspects of the IHRA's examples of antisemitic manifestations.",No,"The tweet in question does not explicitly manifest any of the characteristics defined under the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) as antisemitic. Here's a breakdown based on the JDA guidelines:

1. **General Guidelines**: 
   - There are no statements that essentialize or make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews as a group.
   - The tweet does not link Jews to evil or suggest any form of conspiracy involving Jews.

2. **Manifestation**:
   - The content does not use antisemitic words, images, or deeds. It discusses the visibility of Jewish identity in terms of clothing and hair without negative stereotyping or derogatory language.
   
3. **Directness/Coding**: 
   - The tweet is straightforward and does not employ coded language to convey antisemitic sentiments.

4. **Holocaust Denial**:
   - There are no mentions that deny, minimize, or distort the historical reality of the Holocaust.

5. **Israel-Palestine Context**:
   - The tweet does not relate its discussion to Israel or Palestine in any way that could be interpreted as antisemitic under JDA guidelines 6-10.

The tweet discusses the visibility of Jewish identity and acknowledges different experiences of anti-Jewish hatred, which can vary based on appearance. It then transitions to a commentary about white privilege, suggesting it exists but noting complexities when discussing Jews' place within racial discourse. This is more of an exploration into how identities intersect with racism rather than expressing prejudice or hostility toward Jews.

The IHRA working definition of antisemitism includes several elements such as:

1. **Perception of Jews**: Antisemitism involves a certain perception of Jews that can manifest as hatred or discrimination.
2. **Expressions**: These perceptions may be expressed through speech, writing, visuals, or actions employing negative stereotypes or character traits.
3. **Directing Actions Toward Jewish Individuals or Institutions**: Manifestations include harmful actions directed at Jewish individuals or their properties and institutions.

The tweet itself is brief and lacks specific content within the text provided. However, several factors can guide an interpretation:

- The use of ""A Reminder to American Jews"" could imply a warning or call to action targeted specifically at American Jews, which may invoke negative stereotypes or insinuations depending on what the reminder pertains to.
  
- If this reminder references harmful ideologies or stereotypes against Jews (e.g., associating them with disloyalty, conspiracies), it would align with the IHRA's criteria for antisemitism.

- The link suggests further context might be necessary; if the linked content involves any of the examples provided in the IHRA definition—such as accusations about loyalty, conspiracy theories, or harmful ideologies—it could indeed constitute an antisemitic expression.

Without additional context from the full article referenced by the tweet, there is uncertainty. However, given that it specifically singles out American Jews and implies a reminder potentially tied to negative content (based on typical usages of such phrases), there is a reasonable basis to consider it as possibly aligning with antisemitic expressions under the IHRA definition.

Thus, considering potential implications and common uses of similar language in contexts known for promoting harmful stereotypes or conspiracy theories against Jews, the tweet can be classified as antisemitic. However, this conclusion should ideally be corroborated by reviewing the linked content to fully understand its context and intent.",Unclear,"** 

To determine whether the tweet ""A Reminder to American Jews - Frontpagemag https://t.co/0dNHFBcmqe"" is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), it's important to consider the context and content of both the tweet itself and the associated article, as referenced by its URL.

1. **Lack of Context:** The tweet alone lacks sufficient information. It doesn't provide any content or sentiment which could be analyzed for antisemitic elements based on the JDA guidelines. Without knowing what ""A Reminder to American Jews"" entails, we cannot assess whether it involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews.

2. **Content Analysis:** The JDA emphasizes that antisemitism can manifest through words, images, or deeds and includes direct or indirect forms. If the linked article contains language or imagery fitting these criteria—such as essentializing Jews, making negative generalizations about them, linking them to evil forces, or using coded speech—it could be considered antisemitic.

3. **Specific Guidelines:** 
   - If the article discusses Israel in a way that applies classical antisemitic symbols and stereotypes (Guideline 6) or holds Jews collectively responsible for its actions (Guideline 7), it might meet the criteria for antisemitism.
   - Conversely, if it offers legitimate political criticism of Israeli policies without using antisemitic tropes or imagery, this would not be considered antisemitic according to guidelines like 11-15.

4. **Indirect Assessment:** Without access to the actual content at the provided link, any determination about the tweet's nature remains speculative. We can only analyze potential antisemitism by examining if the article contains any statements that align with the defined characteristics of antisemitism in the JDA guidelines.

This implies a perception of Jews being manipulated to fit into negative stereotypes or categories for certain agendas. According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism includes ""the attribution of evil and sinister intentions to Jews as a collective."" The tweet indicates that Jews are consistently placed in a ""bad"" category due to external manipulations, which can be interpreted as reinforcing negative character traits and stereotypes about Jewish people.

While the tweet does not explicitly match examples listed under the IHRA definition (such as accusations of conspiracy or Holocaust denial), it aligns with the broader description of antisemitism involving dehumanizing and demonizing allegations. The assertion that Jews are always ""put in the 'bad' category"" reflects a perception of collective negativity attributed to them, which can be seen as part of a broader pattern of harmful stereotypes.

Therefore, given its implication that Jews are subject to negative stereotyping based on external agendas, the tweet can be considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet in question states, ""@inspiredsnart Jews are always white or not white, depending on the agenda of who is doing the classing.

To determine whether this statement falls under antisemitism according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), let's break down its components:

1. **Essentializing and Stereotyping**: The tweet highlights how Jews are perceived differently (""white or not white"") based on external agendas, which refers to essentializing or stereotyping as noted in JDA Guideline 1. However, the statement critiques this process rather than perpetuating it.

2. **Linking Jews to Evil**: The latter part of the tweet mentions that Jews are ""always put in the 'bad' category."" While this may seem like a reference to linking Jews with negative attributes, the context suggests an observation or critique of how Jews have been unjustly categorized historically and socially rather than propagating antisemitic beliefs.

3. **Manifestation**: The tweet contains words expressing an idea about external perception but does not include imagery or deeds that are explicitly hostile or violent towards Jews as described in JDA Guideline 3.

4. **Direct vs. Indirect/Antisemitism**: The statement seems to be more of a commentary on the social categorization process rather than a direct or indirect antisemitic expression. It does not make sweeping negative generalizations about Jews, nor does it promote hostility against them.

5. **Holocaust Denial**: There is no reference to denying or minimizing the Holocaust in this tweet, which would clearly be considered antisemitic under JDA Guideline 5.

6. **Israel and Palestine Context**: The tweet does not specifically relate to Israel or Palestinian matters; hence it doesn’t fall into categories directly covered by B.1 through B.15 in that context.

Overall, the tweet critiques how Jews are perceived (""white or not white"") and categorized as ""bad,"" likely reflecting on historical prejudices rather than expressing them. It lacks elements of hostility, discrimination, or conspiracy against Jews themselves, which are key aspects of antisemitism according to the JDA's definition. Therefore, based on these points, this tweet is not considered antisemitic under the JDA guidelines.",1,0,1,0,0,0

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism involves certain perceptions of Jews expressed as hatred or hostility. One aspect of this perception includes spreading false narratives about Jewish identity.

The claim that Ashkenazic Jews descend solely from Khazars is a historical and scholarly debate rather than an established fact. This perspective often aligns with conspiracy theories that seek to delegitimize the Jewish connection to Israel by denying their historical ties to the Middle East, which can be used as part of antisemitic rhetoric. The tweet implies that holding this belief might reflect underlying biases or intentions aimed at undermining Jewish identity and history.

Such a stance could be seen as supporting a stereotype or negative character trait about Jews, particularly if it is intended to dehumanize them or deny their historical experiences and claims. By framing the acceptance of this viewpoint as potentially antisemitic, the tweet aligns with aspects of the IHRA definition that address the spread of mendacious or stereotypical allegations about Jews.

Therefore, while not every individual holding this belief may be an antisemite, the implication in the context of the tweet is consistent with promoting a perception that could contribute to antisemitism, according to the IHRA guidelines.",No,"The tweet in question states, ""If you believe that Ashkenazic Jews are descended from Khazars and have no Middle East ancestry, you just might be an antisemite."" To determine whether this statement is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze it against the provided guidelines.

1. **General Guidelines**: 
   - The JDA emphasizes avoiding essentializing or making sweeping negative generalizations about Jews as a group (Guideline 1). However, the tweet does not generalize negatively; instead, it presents a hypothesis regarding Ashkenazic Jewish ancestry.
   
2. **Classic Antisemitism**:
   - Guideline 2 highlights antisemitic ideas such as portraying Jews as inherently linked to evil or conspiratorial forces. The tweet does not associate Jews with evil or conspiracy but questions a particular historical narrative about their origins.

3. **Manifestation of Antisemitism**:
   - According to Guideline 3, antisemitism can manifest in words, images, or deeds that express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews. The tweet does not exhibit any form of hostility, violence, or direct prejudice against Jewish individuals or institutions.

4. **Direct or Indirect Expression**:
   - The JDA acknowledges both explicit and coded expressions of antisemitism (Guideline 4). However, this statement is neither directly nor indirectly hostile towards Jews; it merely challenges a specific viewpoint about Ashkenazic ancestry.

5. **Holocaust Denial**:
   - Guideline 5 addresses Holocaust denial as a form of antisemitism. This tweet does not mention or relate to the Holocaust in any way, so this guideline is not applicable.

6. **Israel and Palestine Context**:
   - The JDA provides specific guidelines (B) for distinguishing between antisemitic statements related to Israel/Palestine from non-antisemitic criticism (C). This tweet does not address Israel or Zionism directly; rather, it focuses on a historical claim about Jewish ancestry.

In conclusion, the tweet is making an assertion regarding the origins of Ashkenazic Jews and suggests that rejecting certain historical narratives might reflect prejudice. However, it does not meet the JDA's criteria for antisemitism because it lacks elements of discrimination, hostility, or violence against Jews as a group or individuals. It neither utilizes classical antisemitic stereotypes nor engages in any form of denial related to Jewish suffering historically. Thus, according to the JDA guidelines, this tweet is not antisemitic.

It's important to note that debates about historical narratives can be sensitive and complex. While the statement might provoke disagreement or controversy, especially among those who affirm traditional narratives of Jewish ancestry, it does not inherently constitute antisemitism as defined by the JDA.",1,0,1,0,0,0

The tweet explicitly states that ""equating Israel with all the Jews ever"" is anti-Semitic, which aligns directly with one of the specific examples provided in the IHRA guidelines. This action perpetuates a stereotype by suggesting that the behavior or policies of the state of Israel are representative of Jewish individuals worldwide, thereby attributing collective responsibility to all Jews for the actions of a single nation-state.

This notion falls under the pattern described as antisemitic within the IHRA definition because it involves using Israel's actions as a proxy to criticize or attack Jewish people globally. Such rhetoric contributes to harmful stereotypes and can foster an environment where individuals are blamed or targeted based on their perceived association with Israeli policies, which is explicitly highlighted as a form of antisemitism in the IHRA examples. Therefore, this tweet reflects content that aligns with the IHRA's identification of antisemitic behavior.",No,"The tweet in question suggests that equating Israel with all Jews is itself antisemitic. To evaluate this according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to consider several relevant guidelines.

1. **Guideline 7**: This guideline addresses holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's conduct or treating them, simply because they are Jewish, as agents of Israel. The statement in the tweet aligns with this idea by suggesting that equating Israel with all Jews is problematic and potentially antisemitic. It implies a collective responsibility or identification imposed on all Jews based solely on their Jewish identity.

2. **Guideline 8**: This guideline involves requiring people to publicly condemn Israel due to their Jewish identity, which can also relate to the notion of collective responsibility addressed in the tweet.

3. **General Context**: The JDA recognizes that antisemitism often manifests through generalizations or stereotypes about Jews as a group, particularly when it comes to political issues involving Israel. The suggestion made in the tweet aims at preventing such an overgeneralization by warning against conflating the actions of the Israeli state with individual Jewish people.

Therefore, according to these guidelines within the JDA framework, the tweet is making a point that aligns with identifying and cautioning against forms of speech or thought that could be considered antisemitic. It does not itself manifest as direct or indirect prejudice or hostility towards Jews but rather critiques an action (equating Israel with all Jews) that may lead to such outcomes. Thus, based on the JDA's definitions and guidelines, the tweet is not antisemitic; it reflects a caution against potential antisemitism.",1,0,1,0,0,0

1. **Demonization and Dehumanization**: The tweet mentions that ""300 Igbo Jews"" were abducted, which might imply a large-scale targeting based on their Jewish identity. It also states they are at risk of execution, further dehumanizing them by suggesting collective punishment or threat without specific context.

2. **Use of Allegations about State and Government Forces**: By stating that ""58 others in military custody face execution"" and mentioning the destruction of synagogues and arrest of hundreds, it could imply a targeted campaign against Jews, which aligns with the IHRA definition's point on making dehumanizing or demonizing allegations.

3. **Blame and Stereotyping**: The tweet might indirectly suggest that the government forces are acting with antisemitic intent by targeting synagogues specifically, which ties into the IHRA definition regarding accusations of conspiring against Jews or specific targeting based on Jewish identity.

4. **Collective Responsibility**: It suggests a collective threat to all Igbo Jews without differentiating between individuals' actions and their religious or ethnic group membership, aligning with the point about holding groups collectively responsible for perceived threats or actions.

The context provided by the tweet could be interpreted as amplifying negative stereotypes or demonizing perceptions of Jewish communities being targeted due to their identity, which fits within several elements outlined in the IHRA definition of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet discusses the situation of Igbo Jews being abducted and persecuted in Nigeria, specifically mentioning the destruction of synagogues by government forces. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is defined as discrimination or hostility against Jews or Jewish institutions because they are Jewish.

The content of the tweet does not fit this definition for several reasons:

1. **Context and Target**: The tweet focuses on an incident occurring in Nigeria involving Igbo Jews, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes about Jews more generally or attributing negative characteristics to them as a group. It highlights alleged persecution by the Nigerian government, not actions of Jewish individuals or communities.

2. **Intent and Content**: There is no evidence in the tweet that it seeks to essentialize, generalize negatively, or link Jews to evil forces (as described in JDA guidelines 1 and 2). Instead, it reports on what appears to be an act of aggression against a specific group of Jewish people by external actors.

3. **Comparison to Guidelines**: The situation described does not involve attributing the actions of Israel or any stereotypical imagery related to classical antisemitism (guidelines 6-10). It is focused on events in Nigeria, unrelated to the geopolitical context of Israel and Palestine, which the JDA guidelines specifically address regarding potential indirect antisemitic statements.

4. **Nature of Criticism**: While the tweet criticizes certain actions by a government, it does not engage in evidence-based criticism of Jewish institutions or practices globally or portray Jews collectively as responsible for any negative conduct (guidelines 13). It is an account of human rights abuses rather than criticism stemming from antisemitic beliefs.

Therefore, based on the JDA guidelines and definitions, this tweet is not antisemitic. It reports on alleged persecution without linking it to broader harmful stereotypes or ideologies about Jews.",1,0,1,0,0,0

1. **Conspiracy Allegations**: The tweet suggests a scenario during which ""the dems"" (implying Democratic leaders or parties) are accused of specifically arresting Jews among other groups for participating in gatherings without masks. This insinuates an unjust, targeted action against Jewish people, similar to conspiracy theories where Jews are depicted as being unfairly singled out or oppressed by authorities.

2. **Demonization and Stereotyping**: By framing the situation as a ""plandemic"" (a common conspiracy theory term implying that COVID-19 is a planned event), the tweet employs language that often accompanies antisemitic narratives, suggesting hidden agendas orchestrated against certain groups, including Jews.

3. **Targeting Jewish Individuals in Political Contexts**: Associating Jewish individuals with arrests for not wearing masks during protests could imply they are being treated differently or unjustly because of their ethnicity or perceived political alignment. This mirrors the IHRA's mention of accusations that unfairly target Jewish people as part of broader discriminatory acts.

These elements collectively contribute to an antisemitic tone by implying a targeted, conspiratorial action against Jews and utilizing language reminiscent of classic antisemitic themes. Thus, according to the IHRA definition, this tweet can be considered antisemitic.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism is defined specifically as discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). The tweet in question mentions ""arrested Jews,"" but this mention does not inherently demonstrate antisemitic intent or prejudice specific to Jews. Instead, it lists a group of individuals—Jews, Christians, small business owners, and Trump supporters—who were allegedly arrested for gathering without masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The tweet appears to criticize actions by ""the dems"" (Democrats) regarding enforcement measures taken during the pandemic, rather than expressing prejudice against Jews specifically as a group. The reference to Jews in this context seems to be part of a broader list of groups affected by these alleged actions and does not contain elements that align with the JDA's guidelines for antisemitism. There are no sweeping negative generalizations about Jews (guideline 1), nor is there any indication of linking Jews to evil or conspiracy theories (guideline 2). Additionally, the tweet does not manifest through visual images, coded speech, or any other antisemitic forms described in the JDA guidelines.

While the sentiment expressed in the tweet may be politically charged or controversial, it does not rise to the level of antisemitism as defined by the JDA. It is critical to distinguish between a broad political critique and targeted prejudice against Jews specifically, which this tweet does not exhibit based on its content. Therefore, according to the JDA guidelines provided, the tweet would be considered non-antisemitic.",1,0,1,0,0,0

The tweet in question encourages holding British Jews accountable for Israeli military actions in the West Bank, which can be interpreted as a form of collective blame.

Here’s how this aligns with the IHRA definition:

1. **Accusing Jews as a people**: The tweet implies that British Jews should be held responsible for the actions of the state of Israel, effectively accusing them of being collectively accountable. This is an example of attributing the actions or policies of one group (Israeli government) to another distinct group (British Jews), which falls under the antisemitic behavior described by the IHRA definition.

2. **Double Standards and Collective Responsibility**: By singling out British Jews for accountability, this tweet may imply a double standard where Jewish individuals are judged not as independent actors or citizens but as representatives of Israel’s actions. This mirrors the point in the definition about holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.

3. **Contextual Considerations**: The context provided by the tweet suggests that it is not merely criticism of Israeli policy (which is permissible) but a call to hold British Jewish individuals accountable, which crosses into discriminatory and antisemitic territory as defined by IHRA standards.

Thus, while criticizing Israeli policies per se does not constitute antisemitism under the IHRA definition, attributing responsibility for these actions to individual Jews in other countries does. The tweet's implication that British Jews should be held accountable fits this criterion of collective blame, making it antisemitic according to the IHRA working definition.",No,"The tweet makes a distinction between two types of actions or statements regarding the Israeli military and British Jews:

1. **Criticism of Israeli Military Atrocities**: The tweet asserts that criticizing Israeli military actions in the West Bank is not antisemitic. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), evidence-based criticism of Israel as a state, including its policies and practices, is explicitly stated under guideline 13 as not being inherently antisemitic. This includes critique of military conduct, provided it does not employ classic anti-Jewish stereotypes or suggest collective Jewish responsibility.

2. **Holding British Jews Accountable**: The tweet suggests that holding British Jews responsible for the actions of the Israeli state constitutes antisemitism. This aligns with guideline 7 from the JDA, which identifies as antisemitic the act of holding Jews collectively accountable for Israel's conduct or treating them as agents of Israel merely due to their Jewish identity. Such an approach invokes classic antisemitic tropes of collective blame and conspiracy, which are central features outlined in guideline 2.

Therefore, based on the JDA guidelines, the tweet accurately reflects that criticizing Israeli military actions is not inherently antisemitic while holding British Jews accountable for those actions constitutes a form of antisemitism. The tweet itself does not engage in either action but rather provides commentary distinguishing between these two perspectives, making it aligned with the JDA's definitions and distinctions.",1,0,1,0,0,0

My great grandmother was smuggled out of Romania in a hay wagon and nearly impaled when the border guards stabbed the hay with bayonetes.,Yes,"The tweet contains language that can be interpreted as antisemitic according to the IHRA definition of antisemitism. Specifically, it states, ""Jews occupy a special cubby in the locker room of accept/extinguish in the world,"" which implies that Jews are perceived and treated differently from other groups in a negative way. This type of language can contribute to stereotyping and demonizing Jews by suggesting they hold a distinct, possibly problematic position globally.

Furthermore, while the tweet shares personal family history related to Jewish persecution (""My grandmother fled the pogroms of Russia"" and ""My great grandmother was smuggled out of Romania""), it does not provide context for these statements within the sentence that follows them. Instead, it juxtaposes this historical victimization with a contemporary stereotype about Jews being distinctively viewed or treated in the world today, which could reinforce negative perceptions.

The IHRA definition notes that antisemitism involves ""a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews."" While this tweet does not explicitly express hate, it uses language that aligns with sinister stereotypes and can contribute to a broader perception of Jews being different or problematic. Therefore, according to the examples provided by the IHRA definition, such implications fall within the scope of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet in question does not directly express discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews or Jewish institutions, which is the central criterion outlined in the JDA definition of antisemitism. Instead, it reflects a personal narrative that includes family history related to historical events like pogroms and border crossings.

The mention of ""Jews occupy a special cubby in the locker room of accept/extinguish"" might seem metaphorical or ambiguous without additional context. It does not explicitly assert any negative stereotypes or hostile sentiments against Jews as a group, nor does it attribute to them characteristics or actions that align with classic antisemitic tropes such as control, conspiracy, or inherent evil.

The personal anecdotes about the speaker's grandmother and great-grandmother fleeing persecution provide historical context related to Jewish experiences of pogroms and other forms of violence. These narratives serve more to highlight past suffering rather than express any form of contemporary prejudice or hostility against Jews.

Specifically, it uses the phrase ""The King of Jews,"" which can imply a stereotypical or dehumanizing view of Jews by portraying them as belonging to a monolithic group defined solely by their Jewish identity. This kind of expression can perpetuate negative stereotypes and reduce individuals to singular aspects of their identity.

While the tweet seems to be intended as praise for Adam Sandler, its wording may carry antisemitic undertones by associating him with a collective Jewish identity in an inappropriate or stereotypical manner. Such language can contribute to harmful perceptions that align with the IHRA definition's examples of attributing certain qualities or roles to Jews collectively.

Furthermore, while the intent behind the tweet appears positive, context is crucial in determining whether a statement might be antisemitic. Even seemingly benign remarks can contribute to broader patterns of discrimination and prejudice if they rely on or reinforce negative stereotypes about Jewish people. In this case, even without explicit hatred or malice, the phrasing used can fit within the IHRA's examples of how antisemitism manifests through rhetoric.",No,"The tweet ""That's My Boy! Adam Fricking Sandler, The King of Jews!"" does not meet the criteria outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) to be classified as antisemitic. 

1. **Content and Context**: The tweet seems to express admiration or support for comedian Adam Sandler, referencing his film ""That's My Boy"" by using a colloquial expression (""Adam Fricking Sandler"") likely intended to convey enthusiasm rather than hostility. The phrase ""The King of Jews"" does not inherently carry negative connotations but appears to be used in an informal, possibly endearing manner, which is common in fan culture.

2. **Absence of Hostility or Discrimination**: According to the JDA definition, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews. The tweet does not express any form of these negative actions or sentiments towards Jewish individuals or communities. It lacks derogatory stereotypes, accusations of conspiracy, denial of historical events like the Holocaust, or demands for collective responsibility.

3. **No Coded Language**: There is no indication that this statement uses coded language to convey antisemitic messages. The tweet does not associate Jews with evil, accuse them of controlling global institutions, or suggest any form of collective blame related to Israel's conduct.

4. **Cultural Reference**: Adam Sandler, being Jewish himself and known for humor that often includes self-deprecating jokes about his background, is likely the basis for ""The King of Jews"" comment. Fans might use such phrases as a playful nod to his identity rather than an expression of antisemitism.

According to the IHRA definition of antisemitism, manifestations may include targeting Jewish community institutions like synagogues, which is highlighted in this tweet.

Key points supporting the classification as antisemitic under the IHRA guidelines include:

1. **Targeting Synagogues:** The destruction of at least six synagogues is a direct attack on Jewish religious facilities, which is explicitly mentioned in the IHRA definition as an example of antisemitism.

2. **Abduction of Jews:** The abduction and potential execution of individuals identified as ""Igbo Jews"" constitutes an act that targets people based on their Jewish identity or affiliation, aligning with the IHRA's mention of antisemitic acts directed toward Jewish individuals.

3. **Perception of Hostility Toward Jews:** The tweet suggests a hostile action against those perceived to be part of the Jewish community, reinforcing the perception of Jews being targeted for harm, which is a central aspect of antisemitism as defined by IHRA.

In summary, the actions described in the tweet align with examples provided by the IHRA definition that illustrate how antisemitic acts manifest, thereby classifying it as an instance of antisemitism.",No,"The tweet describes an incident involving the abduction of Igbo Jews and the destruction of synagogues by government forces in Obigbo. To determine if this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to assess whether it aligns with the defined elements of antisemitism: discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews.

1. **Targeting Jews**: The tweet specifically mentions ""Igbo Jews"" and the destruction of synagogues, which indicates that Jewish individuals and their religious institutions are being targeted. This fits within the definition of antisemitism because it involves acts of discrimination or hostility directed at Jews due to their identity.

2. **Nature of Actions**: The described actions—abduction and execution in custody, razing synagogues—are violent and hostile. These deeds align with guideline 3 under ""General"" in the JDA, which lists such acts as examples of antisemitic deeds when they are directed against Jews or Jewish institutions.

3. **Contextual Understanding**: The tweet does not involve generalizations about Jews or Israel; instead, it reports on a specific event where Jews appear to be targeted for their religious identity and practices. This context is crucial because the JDA emphasizes that antisemitism involves actions targeting Jews as Jews rather than criticisms of Israeli policies (which are covered in sections B and C regarding Israel and Palestine).

Jews, Romans, Persians. Arabs. Same rule. They became active combatants in these wars.",Yes,"** 

The tweet can be considered antisemitic under the IHRA definition due to its implicit use of a double standard and potentially stereotypical framing, which fits within certain aspects of the definition provided. The user contrasts Muslim participation in warfare with that of Jews by stating ""another lie kaafirs love to perpetuate,"" suggesting that such accusations are false and perpetuated by non-Muslims (referred to as ""kaafirs""). This implies a critique or defense against claims specifically targeting Muslims, but it indirectly uses Jewish historical circumstances as a counterpoint without contextual sensitivity.

1. **Double Standards**: The tweet appears to accuse others of applying double standards — a specific antisemitic manifestation listed by IHRA — by implying that Jews have historically been involved in warfare like all other cultures and thus should not be singled out when discussing child soldiers. It claims equal culpability across different groups without acknowledging the historical contexts, particularly the unique victimization of Jews during events such as the Holocaust.

2. **Historical Context**: The mention of ""Jews"" in this tweet does not address or engage with the specific historical context of Jewish persecution or their victimhood under circumstances like the Nazi genocide. Instead, it uses an example from history to counter a stereotype about another group (Muslims), potentially disregarding the distinct nature of antisemitic stereotypes and histories.

3. **Implications**: While the tweet does not directly accuse Jews or Israel of wrongdoing, its framing suggests that criticisms or negative perceptions are unfairly leveled against Muslims while ignoring similar actions by other groups, including Jews. This can feed into narratives where Jewish experiences during significant historical events (e.g., the Holocaust) are dismissed or misrepresented.

Overall, although the intent may be to defend a particular group, the manner in which it references Jewish history as part of its argument aligns with using double standards and potentially undermines the unique nature of antisemitic experiences, thereby fitting within the IHRA definition.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews specifically because they are Jewish. The tweet in question discusses historical norms regarding when boys would join wars, citing several groups including Jews, Romans, Persians, and Arabs without expressing prejudice, hostility, or discrimination towards Jews as a people or targeting them for harm.

The tweet compares different cultural practices rather than making a negative generalization about Jews or linking them to evil forces.

My bad!,Yes,"The tweet in question can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism due to its implicit use of harmful stereotypes and comparisons. Specifically, it compares the suicide rates of a group (presumably trans people) unfavorably to those of Jews in 1930s Germany—a reference that evokes imagery associated with the Holocaust period when Jews faced extreme persecution and violence under Nazi rule.

This comparison implicitly minimizes the historical suffering and atrocities experienced by Jewish people during the Holocaust, which includes references to ""denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g., gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide."" The tweet's statement could be interpreted as trivializing one of history's most significant genocides by suggesting that another group’s struggles are more severe. Such comparisons can perpetuate a harmful narrative that undermines the unique and profound suffering experienced by Jews during the Holocaust, thereby falling into the category of antisemitic rhetoric.

Additionally, using the tragic circumstances faced by Jewish people in 1930s Germany as a metric for comparison indirectly employs sinister stereotypes about Jewish suffering, which aligns with the IHRA definition. The statement could be perceived as minimizing or invalidating the severity and uniqueness of the Holocaust experience—a point explicitly highlighted within the IHRA examples as a form of antisemitism.

Therefore, based on these considerations, the tweet fits into multiple aspects of the IHRA's description of what constitutes antisemitic behavior in terms of rhetoric.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews specifically because they are Jewish. The tweet in question does not exhibit any of these behaviors directed toward Jews or Jewish institutions. Instead, it makes a comparison involving historical contexts of suffering experienced by different groups: Jewish people during 1930s Germany and African slaves in the 1700s, compared to the contemporary situation faced by trans individuals.

The tweet aims to highlight perceived adversity faced by transgender people today without making negative generalizations or attributing inherent characteristics to Jews. It neither uses antisemitic stereotypes nor links Jews to evil. Furthermore, there is no indication of hostility or prejudice against Jewish people; rather, it seems intended as an observation on the challenges faced by another group.

They're so easy to learn about people were able to spend the last multiple thousand years mocking them.",Yes,"According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, antisemitic acts can include the use of dehumanizing or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective. The tweet in question references mocking Jewish dietary laws, which are an integral part of Jewish religious and cultural identity. By focusing on mocking these practices for millennia, the tweet perpetuates a negative stereotype that singles out Jews based on their religion.

While the tweet does not explicitly express hatred or call for harm, it implicitly supports a long-standing pattern of ridicule towards Jewish customs. This can contribute to an environment where Jews are viewed through a lens of derision, which aligns with antisemitic manifestations as outlined by IHRA. Specifically, it involves making stereotypical allegations about Jews and their practices, fitting within the broader context of historical prejudice and discrimination against Jewish people.

The key issue here is not just the act of mocking dietary laws in isolation but doing so as part of a long tradition of targeting Jewish customs for ridicule, which can contribute to an atmosphere of hostility or contempt towards Jews as a group. This aligns with the IHRA's emphasis on how such acts and perceptions function within societal contexts that have historically marginalized or harmed Jewish communities.",No,"The tweet states that Jews have been mocked for their dietary laws over millennia and implies these laws are easy to understand, leading to continued mockery. According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews or Jewish institutions as Jewish.

1. **General Nature of Discrimination**: While mocking a religious practice can be offensive and disrespectful, it does not inherently rise to the level of discrimination or hostility outlined in the JDA definition unless accompanied by harmful intent or actions. The tweet is an observation about historical behavior rather than a directive for future action against Jews.

2. **Historical Context**: The tweet references a long history of mocking Jewish dietary laws without indicating any new animosity, conspiracy, or stereotype about Jews as evil (as per guideline 2). There is no suggestion that this mockery links to broader harmful stereotypes or fantasies involving Jewish power or malevolence.

3. **Absence of Harmful Consequences**: The tweet does not call for any action against Jews, nor does it portray Jews in a derogatory manner that could lead to discrimination or violence (as per guideline 3). It simply remarks on an existing historical pattern without advocating for future harm.

4. **Lack of Coded Messages**: There is no coded language suggesting Jews possess hidden powers or are inherently linked to negative traits. The tweet lacks the context necessary to be considered a disguised expression of antisemitism (as per guideline 4).

5. **Holocaust Denial Not Present**: The tweet does not deny or minimize the Holocaust, which is specifically highlighted as an example of antisemitic behavior in the guidelines.

While the tweet may be insensitive and perpetuates a stereotype by acknowledging its historical use, it does not fit within the JDA’s criteria for antisemitism, which requires a degree of intent to harm or discriminate against Jews as Jews.

1. **Accusations and Blame**: The tweet falsely implies Jewish responsibility for the violence they suffered during Kristallnacht. This aligns with the IHRA definition's point about accusing Jews as a people for actions committed by others or attributing unwarranted blame to them.

2. **Historical Distortion**: It misrepresents historical facts, suggesting that Jewish communities were blamed and penalized after Kristallnacht in a manner not supported by documented history. This distortion is akin to denying the mechanisms or intentionality of antisemitic events like the Holocaust.

3. **Perpetuation of Harmful Stereotypes**: By implying an inappropriate blame and financial penalty upon Jews, the tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes that have been historically used to justify discrimination against Jews.

This evokes the historical context of antisemitic acts perpetrated by National Socialist Germany during World War II.

1. **Historical Context and Stereotyping**: By referencing ""foreign & 'stateless' Jews"" in a manner similar to Nazi terminology, it invokes stereotypes associated with classic antisemitism. The language used can be seen as perpetuating the narrative of Jews as outsiders or other, which aligns with historical patterns of antisemitic rhetoric.

2. **Indirect References**: Although the tweet does not explicitly use contemporary hate speech or conspiracy theories about Jews, its reference to methods similar to those used in Holocaust persecutions can imply a sinister undertone that is connected to antisemitism as defined by IHRA. This includes invoking images and symbols associated with classic antisemitic acts.

3. **Criminal Acts Context**: The mention of sorting at an assembly center without regard for humanitarian exceptions (other than to ""save time"") echoes the dehumanizing practices employed during the Holocaust, thus reinforcing harmful stereotypes about Jews as targets in genocidal contexts.

1. **Denial or Distortion of Historical Facts**: The tweet implies a misunderstanding or denial of the chronological reality of the Holocaust and the establishment of Israeli statehood (""It was before Palestinian Jews realized the Nazis planned a holocaust of Jews""). This can be seen as an attempt to deny or distort the historical facts surrounding the Holocaust, which is explicitly mentioned in the IHRA definition as antisemitic.

2. **Stereotyping and Misrepresentation**: The tweet suggests that Jewish motivations during World War II were primarily about migration rather than survival from genocide (""Part of the motivation was to get Jews out of Europe, and to Palestine""). This misrepresents the historical reality and the desperate situation faced by European Jewry at the time, which aligns with antisemitic stereotypes that trivialize or dismiss Jewish suffering during the Holocaust.

3. **Implying a Conspiracy or Manipulation**: By suggesting alternative narratives about Jewish actions during WWII without acknowledging the dire circumstances (""It wasn't Shamir, it was Stern""), the tweet can be interpreted as implying some form of conspiracy or manipulation within the Jewish community itself, which echoes antisemitic tropes about Jews controlling events for their own purposes.

These aspects of the tweet collectively contribute to a portrayal that aligns with the IHRA's characterization of contemporary antisemitism, involving distortion and trivialization of historical facts related to the Holocaust. As such, the content can be considered antisemitic according to the provided definition.",No,"To determine whether the tweet is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), we need to analyze its content against the provided definition and guidelines.

1. **Content Analysis**: The tweet references historical figures and events, specifically relating to Jewish motivations for migrating from Europe to Palestine before the Holocaust. It mentions ""Shamir,"" which refers to Yitzhak Shamir, a former Israeli Prime Minister, in connection with earlier Zionist movements led by figures like Ze'ev Jabotinsky (likely referred to as ""Stern""). The tweet suggests that part of the motivation for Jewish migration was influenced by awareness (or lack thereof) regarding Nazi plans.

2. **Application of Guidelines**:
   - **Guideline 1**: There are no generalizations about Jews being inherently negative or linked to evil.
   - **Guidelines 2 and 3**: The tweet does not employ classical antisemitic stereotypes, imagery, or conspiracy theories involving Jews as agents of evil or possessing undue influence.
   - **Guideline 4**: There is no coded language implying hidden Jewish power or control over governments or institutions.
   - **Guideline 5**: There is no denial or minimization of the Holocaust. The tweet acknowledges awareness issues about Nazi plans, which does not equate to denying historical facts.

3. **Contextual Consideration**:
   - The tweet appears to be discussing historical motivations for Jewish migration rather than making contemporary accusations against Jews.
   - It seems to engage in a debate over historical interpretations without attributing blame or negative characteristics to Jews as a group today.

According to the IHRA definition, antisemitism can manifest through rhetoric that employs negative stereotypes or dehumanizing allegations about Jews as a collective group. By linking a historical action (denying entry to European Jews) with a contemporary remembrance of the Holocaust without further context, this tweet could perpetuate harmful stereotypes or be interpreted as minimizing the unique and systemic nature of antisemitic policies during the Holocaust.

Furthermore, such comparisons can align with other elements listed in the IHRA definition that contribute to antisemitism. For example:

1. **Mendacious Allegations**: The suggestion that a tactic used against Jews in the 1930s was similar or equivalent to actions today can imply false equivalencies and reinforce harmful stereotypes.

2. **Historical Minimization**: By casually mentioning the exclusion of European Jews in such a manner, it risks minimizing the severity and specific nature of antisemitic policies during World War II.

3. **Comparison with Nazi Actions**: If perceived as comparing contemporary policy or sentiment to those used by Nazis against Jews, this could align with IHRA's noted examples where drawing comparisons between modern Israeli policy and that of the Nazis is considered antisemitic.

Overall, without additional context or clarification, the tweet can be seen as contributing to a harmful narrative and thus falls within the scope of what the IHRA defines as antisemitism.",No,"**

The tweet in question states: ""Fun fact for Holocaust Remembrance Day: this was the same tactic used to keep European Jews out of the United States in the 1930s."" It refers to a practice that could be relevant during the Holocaust era, without directly making any negative generalizations or statements about Jews as Jews. Here’s how it aligns with the JDA guidelines:

1. **Contextual Reference:** The tweet references historical events concerning Jewish immigration restrictions in the United States during the 1930s. This is a factual reference to a policy period that affected many European Jews seeking refuge from persecution.

2. **Lack of Hostility or Prejudice:** There is no inherent hostility, discrimination, prejudice, or violence directed against Jews as individuals or as a group within this statement. The tweet does not attribute negative traits to all Jews, nor does it make sweeping generalizations about them.

3. **Historical Acknowledgment:** Mentioning the historical tactic used to prevent Jewish immigration during the 1930s can be seen as an acknowledgment of past injustices faced by Jews rather than perpetuating antisemitic stereotypes or conspiracy theories (Guideline 2).

4. **Holocaust Remembrance Context:** The tweet is posted in the context of Holocaust Remembrance Day, which implies a focus on remembering and acknowledging historical events related to Jewish persecution.

5. **No Coded Language:** There are no coded messages about Jews being linked to negative forces or possessing undue power (Guideline 4).

6. **Not Denying Historical Facts:** The tweet does not deny the Holocaust or minimize its impact; rather, it could be seen as drawing attention to historical practices that were part of a broader context of discrimination against Jews.

Given these points, the tweet does not align with any specific antisemitic behaviors as defined by the JDA. It lacks essential elements like hostility, prejudice, generalization about Jews, or coded antisemitism in its message.

The tweet suggests that ""Left Wing Jews"" are distinct in some negative way by indicating surprise at the need for only two questions to elicit a specific type of response. This could imply a stereotype or prejudicial perception toward Jewish individuals based on their political orientation.

1. **Perception and Stereotyping:** The tweet seems to categorize Jews, specifically ""Left Wing Jews,"" in a manner that might suggest they have an intrinsic characteristic leading them to respond negatively or unexpectedly. This aligns with the IHRA definition's mention of using negative character traits and stereotypes about Jewish people.

2. **Contextual Implication:** While it doesn't explicitly make dehumanizing, demonizing, or conspiratorial claims as outlined in examples from the IHRA definition, the implication of needing only ""two questions"" to provoke a certain response could be interpreted as attributing a specific negative trait or behavior to Jews based on their political views.

3. **Potential for Harm:** The tweet can contribute to antisemitic attitudes by reinforcing stereotypes and potentially leading to prejudice against Jewish individuals, particularly those identified with left-wing politics.

In conclusion, while the tweet does not directly match some of the more explicit examples provided in the IHRA definition, it falls within the scope of antisemitism by perpetuating negative perceptions and stereotypes about a subset of Jews based on their political affiliation.

It took 2 questions to make him respond that way about Left Wing Jews."" This tweet refers to a situation where an unspecified individual takes two questions to express their thoughts on ""Left Wing Jews,"" and the user finds it shocking. 

Based on the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines:

1. **General Guidelines**: The tweet does not make sweeping negative generalizations about all Jews or suggest that Jews, as a group, are linked to evil forces, which would align with classic antisemitic themes.

2. **Manifestation in Words/Deeds**: While the tweet mentions ""Left Wing Jews,"" it doesn't inherently carry discriminatory, prejudicial, hostile, or violent intent against Jews solely because they are Jewish. Instead, it comments on a specific political orientation of some individuals within the Jewish community.

3. **Indirect/Antisemitic Contexts**: The tweet does not appear to use coded language implying that Jews control certain institutions or engage in conspiracies. It is also not denigrating Jews as a whole but seems to criticize an individual's response time regarding a specific subgroup of Jews (Left Wing Jews).

4. **Israel and Palestine Context**: The tweet doesn't seem related to any discussions about Israel or the state of Palestinian affairs, nor does it attribute collective blame to Jews for actions taken by Israeli policies.

5. **Non-Antisemitic Criticism**: According to JDA's guidelines on non-antisemitic criticism (guideline 13), criticizing specific political ideologies within a group without generalizing negatively about the entire group is not inherently antisemitic.

The tweet in question expresses suspicion towards ""leftist libs"" and implies that they will betray or harm their ""friends"" once a certain objective is achieved. While the tweet does not explicitly mention Jews, it contains elements that could be interpreted as antisemitic when considered within the broader context of how such statements are often used to spread fear or distrust towards certain groups.

1. **Stereotyping and Generalization:** The language used suggests a stereotypical view of betrayal associated with leftist individuals, which can echo harmful stereotypes historically attributed to Jewish people — particularly in conspiracy theories that portray Jews as deceitful or having ulterior motives. While the tweet does not directly name Jews, it invokes a kind of rhetoric that has been used against them.

2. **Fear and Distrust:** The suggestion that once certain political objectives are achieved, those who support these aims will be betrayed, echoes narratives often found in antisemitic conspiracy theories where Jewish individuals or groups are depicted as manipulative or duplicitous.

3. **Contextual Implications:** If this tweet is part of a broader pattern of communication by the user that includes explicit antisemitic content or aligns with such themes, it strengthens the interpretation that the language could be indirectly targeting Jews through coded or implied messaging.

While the tweet does not explicitly fall under all categories of the IHRA definition — such as making dehumanizing allegations about Jews specifically — its implications and potential to reinforce harmful stereotypes contribute to a perception aligned with antisemitic discourse. Therefore, considering these factors, it can be evaluated as potentially antisemitic according to the IHRA guidelines.",No,"The tweet in question uses general language that refers to ""friends"" and political dynamics, without specifically targeting or singling out Jews or Jewish institutions.

Key points from the tweet:
1. It makes a broad statement about political dynamics that could apply to many scenarios beyond those involving Jews.
2. There is no direct reference to Jews, Judaism, or Jewish characteristics in either explicit or coded language.
3. The tweet does not employ stereotypes, symbols, or imagery typically associated with antisemitism.
4. It does not suggest a conspiracy theory involving Jews nor portrays them as inherently linked to evil forces.

The JDA outlines various forms of antisemitic speech, such as coded messages about Jewish control over financial systems (Guideline 4) or applying negative stereotypes to Israel in ways that reflect classic antisemitism (Guideline 6). However, the tweet does not fall into these categories. 

While it may express a cynical view on political alliances and outcomes, without targeting Jews explicitly or implicitly through recognized patterns of antisemitic rhetoric as outlined by the JDA, the content of this tweet is not considered antisemitic according to those guidelines.

Specifically, it implies that a certain action or event can be attributed to God (G-d), which is capitalized here as a deliberate reference to Jewish identity and religious beliefs. This phrasing invokes classic antisemitic stereotypes by suggesting that Jews have control over events through divine intervention.

Such an implication contributes to the harmful notion of a powerful Jewish conspiracy, where Jews are perceived as having undue influence or control over worldly matters through mystical or supernatural means. By linking this stereotype to humor or mockery (""Laughed until I cried""), the tweet reinforces negative characterizations and potentially demonizes Jewish religious beliefs.

This aligns with the IHRA's example that includes ""making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such,"" specifically referring to myths around a world Jewish conspiracy. Therefore, even in the absence of explicit language condemning Jews directly, this tweet perpetuates harmful stereotypes that contribute to antisemitism according to the IHRA definition.",No,"The tweet in question states, ""Laughed until I cried.

1. **Absence of Discrimination or Hostility**: The tweet does not exhibit discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews.

2. **Context and Intent**: Without additional context or content from the linked material (https://t.co/ahpvjiwxOF), it's challenging to determine if there are underlying antisemitic messages.

This language can contribute to a perception of Jews as a distinct and separate group, potentially fostering negative stereotypes or perceptions. Although the tweet directs viewers to an informational video by Dr. Zackary Sholem Berger about COVID-19 measures for observant Jewish communities (""frum Jews""), it is important to consider both the language used and its potential implications.

1. **Targeting a Jewish Collective**: By using ""Yidn,"" the tweet singles out a specific Jewish group (observant or religiously practicing Jews) in a manner that can be seen as targeting them collectively. This aligns with the IHRA definition which includes targeting the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity; similarly, targeting any subset of Jewish people could fall under this.

2. **Connotations and Context**: The choice of language might not necessarily imply hatred or conspiracy but still contributes to an environment where Jews are singled out negatively. Language matters greatly in public discourse, especially when it can contribute to antisemitic sentiments by reinforcing stereotypes or making a group seem distinctly separate from the broader community.

3. **Intent and Perception**: While there may not be explicit malicious intent in calling attention to guidance on COVID-19 practices for Jewish communities, the use of ""Yidn"" is problematic because it resonates with historical and ongoing antisemitic tropes. The perception created by such language can foster an environment that aligns with negative stereotyping or discrimination.

In conclusion, while the content of the tweet focuses on public health guidance, the choice of words carries implications that fit within aspects of the IHRA definition of antisemitism, primarily through the use of derogatory terminology and targeting a Jewish group in a way that could be perceived as harmful.",No,"According to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) guidelines, antisemitism involves discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish), often characterized by stereotypical portrayals and baseless generalizations.

The tweet in question states: ""WATCH: Yidn, listen to what this doctor is saying! Dr. Zackary Sholem Berger explains what frum Jews must do and not do to stop the spread of COVID-19."" It directs attention to a video by Dr. Zackary Sholem Berger about measures for Jewish individuals (specifically those who are observant or ""frum"") in relation to COVID-19.

Here's why this tweet is not considered antisemitic under the JDA:

1. **Content Focus**: The primary focus of the tweet appears to be public health advice tailored for a specific community, which aligns with responsible communication during a pandemic. It does not exhibit hostility or discriminatory language against Jews as a group.

2. **Language Use**: Although the term ""Yidn"" can sometimes be used pejoratively, it is often reclaimed by Jewish individuals and communities in informal contexts to refer to themselves. In this context, without additional context indicating malice or intent to harm, its use alone doesn't satisfy antisemitic criteria as defined by JDA.

3. **Intended Message**: The tweet seems to promote a message intended for the benefit of public health within the Jewish community. There is no indication of linking Jews with evil forces, conspiracy theories, or other antisemitic motifs outlined in guidelines 2 and 3 of the JDA.

4. **No Derogatory Stereotypes or Hostility**: The tweet does not use derogatory stereotypes nor shows hostility against Jews. Instead, it shares a resource presumably aimed at informing and protecting that community from COVID-19.

The tweet mentions ""How the Israel Lobby Captured Hillel"" and suggests that Hillel International is no longer welcoming for Jews of all persuasions due to an alleged influence by the ""Israel Lobby."" While the phrase itself does not explicitly mention Jewish people in a negative light, it implies a scenario where external forces (associated with Israel) are exerting control over Jewish organizations, thus marginalizing certain groups within the Jewish community.

This narrative could be seen as employing a form of double standard or delegitimization tactic by implying that Israel or its supporters unduly influence Jewish institutions to their detriment. The tweet's implication that Hillel is no longer inclusive can indirectly suggest that Jews who are critical of Israel are being ostracized, which aligns with the IHRA definition involving antisemitic discrimination where Jews may be collectively held responsible for actions linked to the state of Israel.

It implies that the influence of an Israel lobby has altered Hillel's character from being inclusive to possibly less so.

To determine if this is antisemitic according to the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA), let’s analyze it in light of the provided guidelines:

1. **General Context and Target**: The tweet does not target Jews as individuals or collectively as a people, nor does it make sweeping negative generalizations about them being inherently linked to evil or possessing hidden powers (Guideline 2).

2. **Nature of Criticism**: It criticizes an organization for its alleged shift in influence due to external lobbying rather than expressing prejudice or hostility towards Jews as Jews.

3. **Coded Speech and Context**: While the mention of an ""Israel lobby"" could be perceived as coded language in certain contexts (Guideline 4), without additional context suggesting that this critique is part of a broader antisemitic narrative, it doesn't directly imply that all Jewish people or institutions are inherently problematic.

4. **Political Criticism vs. Antisemitism**: The tweet appears to express political criticism regarding the influence on an organization’s policies or inclusivity, which aligns more closely with Guideline 13 of the JDA. It acknowledges a shift in policy influence rather than making a racialized claim about Jewish people.

Therefore, while some might argue that any mention of an ""Israel lobby"" could be sensitive due to historical antisemitic tropes associating Jews with undue political power, this specific tweet focuses on organizational dynamics without inherently attributing negative traits or intentions to Jews as a group. As such, it does not meet the JDA's criteria for antisemitism based solely on its content and the context provided here.

It’s important to note that broader context could shift interpretations, but with the information available in the tweet alone, it is not inherently antisemitic according to the guidelines of the JDA.",1,0,1,0,0,0

First, it challenges the uniqueness of the Holocaust by comparing Korean ""comfort women"" to Jewish suffering during the Holocaust. This can be seen as an attempt to deny or diminish the specific historical experience and significance of the Holocaust for Jewish people, which is a form of denial listed in the IHRA examples.

Furthermore, the tweet includes statements that could foster harmful stereotypes about Jews by implying they are ungrateful or dismissive towards Japan's role during World War II. It suggests that Jewish people refuse to acknowledge any positive actions taken by Japanese individuals during the Holocaust, potentially feeding into negative character traits and conspiracy-like narratives about Jewish behavior.

Overall, while not overtly hostile in tone, the tweet employs elements that could be interpreted as diminishing the unique historical suffering of Jews during the Holocaust and propagating negative stereotypes. These factors align with aspects of the IHRA definition, specifically regarding denial or minimization of the Holocaust and potentially fostering negative perceptions or conspiracies about Jewish people. Therefore, it can be considered antisemitic according to the IHRA working definition.",No,"The tweet in question does not fall under the antisemitic guidelines outlined in the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The tweet makes a comparison between the suffering of Koreans during World War II, particularly in reference to ""comfort women,"" and that experienced by Jews during the Holocaust. This type of comparison is contentious and can be perceived as offensive or insensitive, but it does not inherently meet any criteria for antisemitism as defined by JDA.

1. The tweet does not include discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish), which are central to the definition of antisemitism according to the JDA.
2. It does not essentialize Jews with negative character traits or make sweeping generalizations about them.
3. There is no indication that it involves the idea of a Jewish conspiracy or links Jews to forces of evil, nor does it depict Jews as inherently possessing hidden power used for malevolent purposes.
4. The tweet does not employ antisemitic words, images, or deeds. It lacks any derogatory characterizations or stereotypes specific to Jews.
5. It is neither denying nor minimizing the Holocaust.

The JDA acknowledges that comparisons between different historical atrocities can be highly sensitive and controversial. However, without additional context suggesting an intent to belittle or distort Jewish suffering in a way that targets Jews as a group, such statements do not automatically constitute antisemitism under this definition. 

It's important to note that while the tweet may lack antisemitic content according to JDA guidelines, it could still be viewed as disrespectful or insensitive by those affected by the referenced historical events. The appropriateness of comparisons between different sufferings is a broader ethical and social discussion separate from identifying antisemitism per se.",1,0,1,0,0,0

The content expresses a rhetorical manifestation that targets Jews with negative stereotypes and character traits, such as ""jews don't deserve to live"" and ""jews are nasty."" These statements employ dehumanizing and demonizing language directed toward Jewish individuals based on their identity.

Furthermore, the tweet implies support or justification for violence against Jews (""WHEN someone will stab the person who sits next to you only because they're Jewish""). This aligns with the IHRA examples that include calling for or justifying harm toward Jews in the name of an extremist view. The rhetorical scenario described encourages viewers to trivialize antisemitic acts, suggesting concern should arise only when such acts directly affect them personally (""WHEN someone will say things like... next to you? WHEN someone will stab the person who sits next to you..."").

Overall, the tweet aligns with multiple aspects of the IHRA definition by promoting negative stereotypes and potentially inciting harm against Jews.",No,"The tweet in question uses rhetorical questions to highlight when antisemitism might become significant or noticeable to someone, by referencing extreme and hateful statements such as ""jews don't deserve to live"" and describing an act of violence against a Jewish person. These examples are clearly expressions of discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews because they are Jewish, which aligns with the JDA's definition of antisemitism.

The tweet itself does not promote antisemitic ideas but instead seems intended to illustrate extreme manifestations of antisemitism by using provocative language in a rhetorical manner. It attempts to provoke thought about when people recognize antisemitism based on egregious examples and does not directly engage in or endorse the prejudiced content it describes. Therefore, while discussing topics related to antisemitism, it is structured as a question rather than an assertion of these views.

Given this context and intent, the tweet appears to be neither expressing nor advocating for antisemitic ideas but rather highlighting instances that clearly fall under the JDA's definition of antisemitism by using exaggerated examples. Thus, according to the JDA guidelines, it is not in itself antisemitic. However, the tone and language could potentially be problematic if interpreted as insensitive or dismissive of genuine concerns about antisemitism, underscoring the importance of context and intent in such discussions.",1,0,1,0,0,0
